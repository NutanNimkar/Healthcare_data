Luis Ardila,CIV100,"Dec 4th, 2024",5.0,2.0,"I was able to learn the course material very well thanks to Professor Ardilla's detailed lectures and attention to detail. He would hold review sessions when he felt the class was falling behind on course content, and was very engaging throughout the semester. If you have Professor Ardilla as your mechanics teacher, you are in good hands."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 13th, 2025",3.0,4.0,"Seica is a fascinating specimen; an enigma of sorts. He doesn't teach well, but has a very thought provoking character. I didn't attend many of his lectures, but this is because I often fainted in the presence of his irradiating persona. If you just care about grades, just grinding his past exams will likely set you up for success."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 10th, 2025",2.0,5.0,Very hard midterms and very poor lectures. However the curve is insane. If you ride the curve you should be fine.
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 20th, 2024",1.0,5.0,"Took this class in first year (2019), never emotionally recovered, had to come back here to warn others. If you're reading this, beware."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 13th, 2024",1.0,5.0,"No, never let him cook again"
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Nov 28th, 2024",5.0,1.0,W professor. Changed my perspective on learning. the way he teaches global equilibrium üôè üòçüò©
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Nov 16th, 2024",3.0,4.0,"Michael Seica gives you an assignment worth 0.5% that takes four hours out of your day every week.
But there isn't one this week.
Also CIV100 is an interesting course, even if the questions could only be created by someone from the deepest depths of Tartarus. 
Lenient on part marks though :)))) you'll never get seica him"
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Sep 27th, 2024",5.0,1.0,Mr.Aura himself. Those who disrespect daddy seica will feel his wrath. D10 didn't stand a chance...
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Sep 25th, 2024",5.0,3.0,"A Professor. Nay, a mentor.

A Chinese proverb says:
""Teacher for a day, father for a lifetime.""

My father was absent throughout my childhood; but, the first day in Seica's classroom, my life became whole.

Seica greets students with a warmth I can only describe as lifechanging.

If you have him for CIV100, run forward into his loving embrace."

Michael Seica,APS160,"May 2nd, 2024",2.0,5.0,Good luck to the people doing online tutorials. Good guy though
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Apr 18th, 2024",5.0,1.0,Very good!
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 31st, 2024",1.0,5.0,Exam is hard as fxxk
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 11th, 2024",3.0,4.0,"IF YOU HAVE CIV100, DO AS MANY PAST PAPERS AS YOU CAN. ACTUALLY CONCEPTUALIZE EVERYTHING AND DON'T LOOK AT THE ANSWERS AND ACT LIKE YOU KNOW WHATS GOING ON. ITS OKAY IF THE CONCEPT TAKES TIME TO SINK, KEEP PUSHING THROUGH; I KNOW YOU GUYS CAN DO IT!!!!!!!!!!! IK YOU GUYS CAN BOSS THE EXAM LIKE ITS JUST A LICKLE' MIYUTE, YOU GUYS GOT THIS STYL!!!!!!"
Michael Seica,APS160,"Nov 10th, 2023",5.0,3.0,The online videos were helpful in the course & It helped me to get a way higher grade than the average in the midterm which means I was better than people who were taking the lectures in-class. Those videos are really helpful.
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Oct 31st, 2023",1.0,5.0,"His test is extremely hard, my life is nightmare"
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Oct 10th, 2023",4.0,3.0,Seica Underrated
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Sep 20th, 2023",5.0,1.0,"I love my daddy sieca, ws in the chat for seica"
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jun 19th, 2023",2.0,4.0,Don't bother going to Seica's lectures. Watch Jeff Hanson on youtube and you will do well.
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Apr 2nd, 2023",2.0,5.0,Mast...lovely introduction videos....life lessons regarding couples.
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Feb 27th, 2023",5.0,1.0,"Michael Seica is an excellent professor for CIV100 due to his engaging teaching style, extensive knowledge, willingness to help students, and incorporation of real-world examples. He creates a positive learning environment and instills a passion for static mechanics in his students."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 14th, 2023",2.0,5.0,"There is too much content and the in-person lectures go at too quick of a pace to get anything across to his students. His online lectures, however, are much better and he makes them available, although they are still not the best. Exams are really tough. He doesn't care about the students it shows when students ask questions."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Nov 30th, 2022",1.0,5.0,"Online lecture videos are super theoretical, I would recommend watching Jeff Hanson on Youtube. The course is super test heavy, and the weekly homework assignments barely count towards your mark. The midterm exam was nothing like any of the homework or suggested textbook problems. Looking through all the past exams help!"
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Oct 28th, 2022",2.0,5.0,"Tough teacher, does not explain things well. Lectures at a rapid pace while making mistakes, making it impossible for students to follow. Presentation of notes is clear at least, and he is straightforward about what is expected of us."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Oct 26th, 2022",2.0,5.0,"His lectures are quite clear, but communicating with him is not great: he doesn't respond to emails and when asked a question, his answers would be blunt."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Feb 18th, 2022",2.0,4.0,hard prof good curve
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 11th, 2022",1.0,4.0,Lectures suck.
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 11th, 2022",1.0,5.0,"Prof Seica is not a bad person, but an arguably less-than-ok professor. The lecture materials recordings and materials are from 8 years ago and it's heavily concept-based, while the assessments focus more on the applied side. He literally wrote ""no email me or TA"" on the syllabus, and there wasn't a piazza for this course. The curve was big tho."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 3rd, 2022",2.0,5.0,"In general, seica is a nice guy. He cracks a joke or two during his tutorials but other than that, his lectures need serious work. This course is bound to be hard nonetheless, so that isnt the biggest issue. the issue with seica was his outdated lecture material and they simply werent helpful."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 3rd, 2022",5.0,5.0,Thank's for the huge curve
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 2nd, 2022",5.0,4.0,"Went into the final with a 92, finished the course with a 99 (final exam + grade got belled like crazy). Seica demonstrates boundless generosity, despite tough exams. The course rewards students who try to think critically about problems. You will need to study hard, apply yourself, force yourself to enjoy the material, but it is rewarding."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 2nd, 2022",5.0,5.0,Got saved by a curve. Thank you!
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 25th, 2021",1.0,4.0,"I didn't mind the course, I actually enjoyed the material, yet he made the midterm and final so hard that it ruined the enjoyment of the course. His lectures were recorded from 5 years ago and he only showed up to skim over the material once a week in tutorial. Overall, course wasn't too bad but he is a horrible professor. Good luck if you have him"
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 14th, 2021",1.0,5.0,"He is an amazing professor, who wish to spend a lot of time deciding how to curve students grades. Thank you so much for bring the terrible final exam to me. I will remember you forever. Goodbye Prof. Seica and never see you again!!!"
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 14th, 2021",1.0,5.0,Amazing professor !
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 13th, 2021",2.0,5.0,"Seica is a nice prof, but his course is hard. Lecture video is useless. I have to read through the textbook by myself to understand the contents. MasterEngineersing quizzes are sucks, its impossible to finish multiple questions in 30 mins. Final exam ruins my life. Its 10 times harder than the assignments we do in daily basis."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 13th, 2021",4.0,4.0,"I think Professor Seica gets too much hate. While his course is hard, he is a good guy who happens to make hard tests."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 13th, 2021",4.0,5.0,Prof. Seica is a unique professor. His lectures are interesting but his exams failed almost everyone.
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 13th, 2021",1.0,5.0,Just finished the exam ! It was a disaster! Worst exam I have ever done in my life
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 12th, 2021",1.0,5.0,He's just really bad dawg
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 12th, 2021",1.0,5.0,"Worst prof at u of t and its not even close. Lectures suck and in addition to what everyone else has said about the teaching quality, he seems like just a genuinely bad person all around."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 6th, 2021",5.0,4.0,Great professor.
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 6th, 2021",1.0,5.0,"His recorded lectures just go through his equations and derive the solutions, while I don't understand what he is trying to do. His tutorials simply REPEAT EVERYTHING he said in the lectures. Watching his lectures is a waste of time, better go to youtube for help."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Nov 14th, 2021",2.0,4.0,"He clearly understands the subject in gret depth, but somehow completely fails to pass this knowledge onto us. Sometimes skips 'a couple' steps in lectures and somehow arrives to the final answer. Seems like he would be a cool uncle tho"
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Nov 10th, 2021",1.0,5.0,I cant even bring myself to watch the lectures anymore and listen to his voice it makes me physically recoil. He uploads all weekly quizzes and assignments from years prior and then ceases contact for semester. Quizzes kill you. Depending on tutorial section you can lose full marks for adding an extra sig fig. Cringe tas but thats normal at uoft.
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Nov 8th, 2021",1.0,4.0,"Online quizzes where you had to do a ton of calculations but only input your final answer so even if you were a little off, you lose the marks. Got a bunch of zeros and found it infuriating. The lectures were confusing."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Nov 6th, 2021",1.0,5.0,"Terrible prof, ruined first year engineering"
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Oct 22nd, 2021",1.0,5.0,I LOVE THIS PROF HAHA I LOVE WHEN HE IS TEACHING A NEW CONCEPT BUT INSTEAD OF SHOWING HIS WORK AND EXPLAINING THE CONCEPT HE GOES STRAIGHT TO THE ANSWER LIKE YOU WOULD IN GRADE 5!
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Oct 21st, 2021",1.0,5.0,"Tame, ridiculous, stressful, and frustrating"
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Oct 21st, 2021",1.0,4.0,"His lectures are difficult to understand because many times he doesn't explain his solution process completely or leaves out very important steps that should have been emphasized. There is extremely little availability for help outside of class, the course only has 1 office hour per week and we are not allowed to ask questions online/email for help"
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Oct 18th, 2021",1.0,5.0,"Man is the worst teacher he can't teach any content but for his videos, all he says is simple concepts."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Sep 28th, 2021",1.0,5.0,"I agree. ""There is a mythical aura about this man- he is the creator of mechanics, the destroyer of triangle law users, and the preacher of the parallelogram. Using 1% of his power, he manages to destroy all of us on the midterm, but then demonstrates his boundless generosity and powers of forgiveness by leading us to salvation with a huge curve."""
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Sep 23rd, 2021",1.0,5.0,yea no
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jul 30th, 2021",1.0,5.0,"This Professor says 'most people fail this course' on the first day of class, already creating a negative environment amongst students. He assigns enormous problem sets with questions randomly graded, so you HAVE to complete all problems. If you having just below a passing grade e.g. 49, he will NOT even listen to you regarding a grade change."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Apr 3rd, 2021",1.0,5.0,MIE100 is easier for me and they say CIV100 is a cake walk. Not with this guy teaching it.
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Feb 27th, 2021",5.0,4.0,"Michael Seica has been my favourite teacher at UofT so far. Contrary to what others may say, his lecture videos were enough to get a basic understanding of the weekly topics. To build on this basic understanding, it is essential that you attend the weekly practical and tutorials to get help with doing actual problems."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Feb 3rd, 2021",1.0,5.0,"Lectures were old videos that had many mistakes in them, tutorials were just a live repeat of lectures (almost verbatim sometimes), destroyed class avg with an exam that was marked very hard. However, Seica is a great person and while tutorials aren't of much value, they are worth going to just to see seica live."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 25th, 2021",2.0,5.0,Awful. Ridiculous. Unreasonable. Thank You!
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 23rd, 2021",1.0,4.0,Destroyed class avgs with the midterm and final exam. His lecture videos are pretty bad and tutorials were basically him repeating the lecture videos.
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 22nd, 2021",2.0,4.0,I love you. Thank you!
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 19th, 2021",1.0,5.0,"Worst prof I had during the pandemic. First of all, his lecture videos were from 2012 for a class you pay a large amount for, and some of the material was not the same as the expectations for this year. He was also very inaccessible and not at all helpful or conducive in helping students learn. He is also an insanely tough marker."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 21st, 2020",3.0,5.0,"Not a big fan of his prerecorded lecture videos, they were a bit too general. He seems like a nice guy but I did not like using Mastering Engineering for our quizzes since most people seemed to do poorly. The final exam was really difficult, in my opinion, more difficult than the past exams."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 17th, 2020",1.0,5.0,The truth is....
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 17th, 2020",4.0,4.0,"Professor Seica taught greatly through his lectures in the first semester, especially with the term being online. Although his approaches are different, but I understood all the concepts taught by him. He was concise and clear for the topics he covered. Overall, it was a great experience learning from him."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 16th, 2020",1.0,5.0,"worst class ive ever taken in my life. considering we are operating in the middle of a pandemic, he did not show any sympathy and was not accessible through email. he was very cold and dismissive to students. my worst highlight of first semester of first year, im sure many feel the same way."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 10th, 2020",1.0,5.0,"His lecture video is useless, never test what he has taught. It is the end of the term, he is still a mystery to me. LOL"
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 7th, 2020",1.0,5.0,It feels like he is avoiding his students.
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 7th, 2020",1.0,5.0,It's really difficult especial taking the course online
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 5th, 2020",1.0,5.0,online class. no lecture. nothing.
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 1st, 2020",1.0,5.0,The worst prof in first year !!!
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Nov 30th, 2020",1.0,5.0,"For urself, avoid this prof, he does not want to teach at all. does not care about students."

Thank you."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Nov 9th, 2020",1.0,5.0,"Takes forever to respond to piazza, doesn't even allow e-mail contact, the attitude towards students is cold and dismissive. It feels as if there is no way at all to reach out to profs. The assignments are not reflective of the student's ability to understand the content. Even if you understand, expect poor results for arbitrary reasons."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Nov 9th, 2020",1.0,5.0,"The teacher specifically avoids teaching the material that will appear on the test. The quizzes are buggy and when students have errors he's unsympathetic to the students' concerns. The tests also ask for 6-11 unknowns, yet he gives you no time to answer them. Overall, if you aren't required to take this course for credit, then please just don't."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Oct 31st, 2020",1.0,5.0,"""Guys I asked you to stop playing please, so there's no more playing now."" - Prof. Michael Seica, October 2020 Mans is terrible, lecture vids suck. Midterm and final exams are way harder than the quizzes you will get, so you need to study a lot more to meet the difficulty of these tests. I just did the midterm and it was the worst test ever."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Oct 31st, 2020",1.0,5.0,His tests are awful.
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Oct 31st, 2020",1.0,4.0,"Horrible prof. Midterms are worth so much, yet are very tough and with very little time to submit. Additionally, midterms are held at a time which is either incredibly late or incredibly early for many international students"
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Oct 31st, 2020",2.0,5.0,"Midterm couldnt solve 2 out of 3, was really prepared and did well on quizzes, nevertheless it was totally different from the previous years exams and supeerrrrr hard I... alright guess thats all you need to know"
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Oct 31st, 2020",1.0,5.0,"The midterm this year consists of only 3 questions, and they are not even released at the same time. One has to wait to do the next question, which is a waste of time. It doesn't mimic a real in-person exam."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Oct 28th, 2020",1.0,5.0,"Given the situation that we can actually get to U of T with the pandemic, the teaching team can not make Midterm flexible but restrict the time to take it. Even the Midterm is at Saturday morning 9 a.m, meaning 9 p.m for students in another part of the world."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Oct 19th, 2020",1.0,5.0,"An absolutely terrible professor doesn't care for students at all. Masteringengineering is terrible, he can't teach for his life, is very rude and boring, basically as bad as it gets."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Oct 19th, 2020",1.0,5.0,"Masteringengineering quizzes are horrible, midterm and final worth 75 percent total..... not a fun time. Pre recorded lectures leave me more confused than before."

Michael Seica,CIV100,"Sep 10th, 2020",1.0,4.0,Confusing
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Apr 3rd, 2020",1.0,5.0,"He helped me so much, helped me to discover how much I would never want to take a CIV course ever again."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Mar 18th, 2020",1.0,5.0,"Very very very condenscending prof. He does not give constructive feedback and finds any way to deduct marks. Don't even bother asking for a mark adjustment because he'll just respond very rudely. As he uses very outdated questions, I'm pretty sure he hasn't changed his method since 2010 or something. No one deserves to have him as a teacher."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Feb 18th, 2020",2.0,4.0,"We had to watch his videos which could be made in half the time, plus dated with errors. The weekly problem sets are nice as theyre great exam prep but i can't specifically give him credit for that since it's practiced in all sections of CIV100. He's slow so you gotta be patient with him, but can give you attitude if you ask a question."
Michael Seica,APS160,"Jan 9th, 2017",1.0,4.0,"Okay at teaching, doesn't know how to wright or organize an exam. Doesn't care about students"

Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 9th, 2017",1.0,4.0,"most uncaring prof I had in term1. Worst experience in his online class. Only 2 times he actually spent some time in tut: 1. before midterm, 2. before prof evaluation due. Do not take his online course, he never updated his lec vid, even there's errors in them. Do not take his course."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 14th, 2016",3.0,5.0,"I took his experimental online course this year. Workload2-2.5 regular courses. We gave assigns&quizzes before finals.  He did not update his online lecture vids in 3 yrs, even he got errors in them.  Uncaring, had minimum interest in tut or answering question or in this course in general.  Don't believe him and take CIV online."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 25th, 2015",5.0,2.0,"I took a probationary level course with him and I thought I was an absolutely hopeless student who had no chance to pass. However, Prof. Seica was so kind and patient (as long as you don't cut him off or ask irrelevant questions during lectures!) and explained amazingly well, especially with his relevant analogies. Thanks prof!"
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Dec 14th, 2014",3.5,4.0,"He's a tough grader but an excellent teacher. Sometimes a little slow, so you need to have patience with him, but weekly quizzes definitely worth it."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Feb 7th, 2014",4.0,2.0,"This professor is good. The weekly quizzes are a good way to get people to keep up with the course material. During the semester his section is more difficult than others (because of weekly quizzes), but the final exam is easier for people in his section. This can be seen with the final exam results."
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Sep 6th, 2013",4.0,4.0,"Very good prof. The weekly quizzes were the most helpful part of all. He's tough, but he can get the best out of you. Deserves far more credit than what he gets."
Michael Seica,CIV1,"Apr 3rd, 2012",5.0,2.0,Complaints about this prof dont make sense. He was a flawless finominal teacher with weekly quizzes and problem sets which helped my class ace the final. He was helpful and caring. Haters are just people who didn't understand/take interest in the course in general. He cant work miricales. Good prof.
Michael Seica,CIV101,"Aug 3rd, 2011",1.5,5.0,Worst prof. Clearly not interested in teaching and was literally texting while students were asking him questions. Gives weekly assignments and hard quizzes. Avoid this prof!
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Apr 19th, 2011",1.0,5.0,Mean prof. Watch out for the final. He put in stuff that he never taught and has never been on any final for the course for the past 10 years.
Michael Seica,CIV100,"Jan 19th, 2010",2.0,4.0,"Sets really hard midterms, but gets you prepared for finals. I did very bad on the midterm but thought the final was really easy."
Michael Seica,CIV101,"Dec 21st, 2008",5.0,4.0,Very Good :)
Michael Seica,CIV0105,"Apr 9th, 2008",5.0,5.0,"This professor is wonderful, His  weekly problem sets and assignments are a lot harder than other section but the class  ALWAYS ends up getting the higher average. Termwork was hard(only worth 40%) but exam was a breeze (worth 60%). i aced the exam and ended up acing the class. i recommend him."
Michael Seica,CIV101,"Jan 17th, 2006",3.5,2.0,"Very good prof, explains things pretty clearly. Isn't very helpful when you ask him questions, he will rather tell you to look at the notes. He gives an assignment and a quiz every week, too much work!! His quizzes are fair though. Hard to get along with, tells you to get out of the class if you talk or cell phone rings."

Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Jan 10th, 2025",5.0,4.0,Very difficult course but professor mercan explains well. Lectures can be a little fast paced but are mostly understandable. Good selection of practice problems in lectures.
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Jan 5th, 2025",4.0,3.0,"Prof Mercan talks very quickly and only uses the blackboard, which worked well for me because I was able to follow along and didn't find the material too difficult. Every so often she would create a handout containing all the information we had covered up to then. Before the final, she took one lecture to review everything in the whole course."
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Nov 25th, 2024",5.0,3.0,"Oya is a very good prof whose lectures, while being fast paced, are really well structured and they help to understand the problem sets and tests."
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Nov 25th, 2024",5.0,3.0,"Oya's lectures are great, she clearly explains topics and gives numerical examples that directly relate to homework sets and quizzes. She may seem a little scary at the beginning but over time you can see that she is one of the best lecturers in first year."
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Sep 26th, 2024",5.0,3.0,She is efficient and explains things clearly.
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Aug 14th, 2024",2.0,3.0,"She speaks very quickly in lectures, making an already difficult course even more annoying to understand. She also sometimes gets annoyed at questions from students. She uses the chalkboard, so sitting anywhere past the middle of the lecture hall will make some of the things she writes almost impossible to read when they're at the top/bottom."
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Jan 11th, 2024",4.0,5.0,"Prof. Mercan was an amazing lecturer who had her course structured fairly different from the other profs, but it always was to our benefit.

Pros:
- Useful problem sets to introduce you to the material
- Great lectures, very clear and always open to answer questions
Con:
- Gets annoyed if a question makes her repeat something she's previously said"
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Jan 10th, 2024",5.0,3.0,"Professor Mercan, a caring educator, took a unique approach in CIV100, covering 2D equilibrium first, then 3D. Her detailed problem-solving in class and willingness to stay after class, patiently addressing repeated questions, created a supportive learning environment. Her impact reached beyond the classroom, making her a remarkable teacher."
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Dec 17th, 2023",5.0,4.0,"She sometimes seems a bit distant or cold, but once you're in her class for long enough you can tell she truly has your best interests in mind and cares a lot. She's a bit of a ""tough"" love professor sometimes, but it really pays off for finals/midterms when other classes haven't received that initial shock from smaller quizzes/assignments."
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Jan 18th, 2023",4.0,4.0,"Guys don't sleep on Mercan. She doesn't follow the same problem sets as the other classes, but that doesn't really matter too much. Mercan is a great teacher. At first, I didn't appreciate her, but then I started dynamics with Sullivan and now I miss her so much. I love you Mercan"
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Dec 13th, 2022",5.0,2.0,The course syllabus is structured terribly but Prof. Mercan isn't responsible for the structure. She takes a different approach to the course content compared to the other profs giving the same lecture but I like it a lot. The weekly homework is great review material. Make sure you fully understand how to solve them. There's always a curve.
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Oct 19th, 2022",5.0,4.0,"The CIV100 course itself is a nightmare: lots of problem sets, super tedious work and tough content overall. However, Mercan does a great job of explaining concepts and her example-heavy teaching style rlly makes it easier to apply theory to practical problems."
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Jan 30th, 2021",5.0,1.0,"If you are taking CIV100 just hope she is your Tut teacher, she explains topics very well!"
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Dec 21st, 2020",4.0,5.0,"I didn't enjoy the course but Prof Mercan explained concepts well in tutorials. For the first few weeks, she was a bit tough, she turned off our chat privileges :((( But overall she's a good prof who explains concepts pretty well."
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Dec 18th, 2020",4.0,2.0,"Gave good lectures. She once had a bit of a heated gamer moment and yelled at the class / into space when frustrated, threatening to deduct marks from all of our quizzes. This latter part was a pretty empty threat since each quiz section was curved to a 70 anyways. Kinda wild. Still she's a good teacher. Our section (ECE) beat the civs at civ"
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Nov 29th, 2019",5.0,4.0,Mercan is the best prof I've had this semester. Her lectures are concise and effective. Don't skip lecture! She is hilarious without realizing it. She also was in tutorial and was very approachable and helpful.
Oya Mercan,CIV519,"Dec 21st, 2015",2.5,4.0,"Mercan is a very confusing teacher. her graduate exams are very difficult since they involve extensive knowledge on undergraduate classes that she did not review. Such as how springs and cables act as truss bars. Also when she is teaching, she tends to over complicate complex topics. She does not require a textbook but I recommend Hibbler  to pass."
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Dec 8th, 2015",4.0,2.0,Pretty good prof. Her accent is a bit hard to understand but she explains everything very clearly. Be sure to read ahead when she's about to start a new topic because you won't understand otherwise.
Oya Mercan,CIV100,"Dec 8th, 2015",4.5,4.0,"Although her lecture is sometimes difficult to understand unless you focus really well in lecture, she would be really resourceful. And definitely ask her questions after class and she is fantastic!"
Shoshanna Saxe,CIV100,"Jan 4th, 2025",5.0,3.0,"she was so caring and nice and knew how to teach in the simplest way that I, as an ESL would engage in her lectures fully. If you want to get a good grade in the finals, attend the classes and take notes because she goes fast. The final exam was difficult since the course coordinator was someone else."
Shoshanna Saxe,CIV100,"Oct 16th, 2019",2.0,5.0,"Trash prof, with horrible office hours and explanations. I found that she didn't take her role seriously, and rather ran off to meetings. Her office hours are not helpful as well. And she is not capable of explaining difficult concepts in a way most can understand sadly."
Shoshanna Saxe,CIV100,"Nov 18th, 2017",4.0,5.0,"Great teacher, but she likes to watch you suffer through impossible quizzes and assignments"
Earl Magsipoc,civ100,"Dec 6th, 2024",5.0,1.0,"Earl is a great teacher, always answering questions during lectures and trying to help us out with as many examples as possible during lectures. He would even come to our tutorials and give us hints on our weekly problem sets. Awesome instructor and would definitely reccomend!"
Anthony Sinclair,MIE100,"Apr 5th, 2024",5.0,3.0,"The best professor by far in my first year. Explains concepts and examples very clearly, and even provides a coffee break in every lecture to help students calm down a bit. Very kind and willing to help. Amazing professor."
Anthony Sinclair,MIE100,"Feb 27th, 2024",1.0,3.0,"Horrible man who called Palestinians ""the enemy"""
Anthony Sinclair,MIE100,"Feb 4th, 2024",5.0,1.0,good professor
Anthony Sinclair,MIE100,"Jan 26th, 2023",5.0,2.0,"Anthony is a wonderful specimen of a human being. He makes very relevant jokes during lecture, takes a nice 10 minute break every lecture, explains everything wonderfully, honestly one of my favorite professors at the moment. Out of the entire MIE100 teaching team this semester, he genuinely should have been the course co-ordinator."
Anthony Sinclair,MIE100,"May 26th, 2022",5.0,2.0,"Extremely good professor who explains concepts very clearly and concisely. He puts effort into making the classroom environment light-hearted through jokes and his ""coffee breaks"".  His lecture notes are comprehensive and very clear. He also gives lots of exam tips and his practice questions help a lot. Definitely one of the best."
Anthony Sinclair,MIE100,"Apr 14th, 2022",5.0,2.0,"One of the best professors I had in my freshman year. He gives outstanding lectures, and the examples he discusses during class are short, simple, and extremely useful. One of the most enjoyable parts of his lectures is his coffee breaks, which make me feel refreshed. Because, well, I have short attention spans."
Anthony Sinclair,MIE100,"Apr 5th, 2022",5.0,3.0,"This guy gives awesome lectures. Even if the material is difficult, he includes simple examples that help foster an understanding for the subject matter. Whether it be his hilarious jokes, the 10 or so minutes of 'coffee time', or the course itself, there's always something to look forward to in Sinclair's class."
Anthony Sinclair,MIE100,"May 18th, 2021",5.0,4.0,"Great Professor, really knows how to explain the concepts of this demanding class."
Anthony Sinclair,MIE100,"Apr 20th, 2019",5.0,4.0,"Prof. Sinclair has been my favourite in first year. He is one of the few instructors who know how to explain and teach, and answers questions so clearly. Also love his sense of humor, and the coffee breaks!!!"
Anthony Sinclair,BME1452,"Dec 11th, 2017",5.0,4.0,"Tony is pretty accessible outside class. He is smart, funny and the best in teaching. Signal processing course was too tough tho."
Anthony Sinclair,MIE100,"Apr 18th, 2017",5.0,3.0,Super smart
Anthony Sinclair,MIE100,"Jan 13th, 2016",5.0,1.0,Love his lectures
Anthony Sinclair,MIE100,"Mar 9th, 2015",5.0,3.0,"MIE100 tough course but he teaches the best among the profs, class is always crowded"
Anthony Sinclair,MIE100,"Aug 8th, 2014",4.0,4.0,Funny professor and really cocky but teaches one of the best.
Geoffrey McGregor,MAT186,"Jan 13th, 2025",2.0,4.0,"Really nice guy - but if you aren't already proficient in this level of math it's really hard to keep track of what he's doing. Would constantly skip steps during lecture and solve questions by memory (from past years doing the same questions). Often found myself very confused during lecture, always having to find more resources online to clarify."
Geoffrey McGregor,MAT188,"Jan 13th, 2025",5.0,3.0,"Awesome Prof, saved my life, I got a 36% on my first midterm and eventually caught up and scored 86% on my second midterm and 90% on my final"
Geoffrey McGregor,MAT188,"Jan 10th, 2025",5.0,3.0,"Very good lectures and problems in lecture. Clear explanations, if you can do his lecture problems you are ready for anything."
Geoffrey McGregor,MAT188,"Jan 6th, 2025",5.0,3.0,"Go to lecture and use his lecture notes as homework. His lecture notes are super helpful. Most of the time, if you can do the lecture slides, you're good."
Geoffrey McGregor,MAT186,"Jan 5th, 2025",4.0,3.0,"His lectures make it very easy to understand the material. I found the PCEs to be confusing, but it was all cleared up in practice problems during class."
Geoffrey McGregor,MAT186,"Dec 15th, 2024",5.0,1.0,"Professor McGregor was amazing. Super helpful lectures showing examples from past exams. He tells you exactly what you need to know. Very good at explaining concepts and his examples are always helpful in learning how to look at problems. Greatest calc prof in existence, plus he's super chill and approachable!"
Geoffrey McGregor,MAT186,"Dec 6th, 2024",5.0,2.0,W prof just trust me
Geoffrey McGregor,MAT186,"Nov 25th, 2024",4.0,4.0,"Geoffrey cares about his students, and his lectures are good, but sometimes the pace is very quick. Calculus is definitely a difficult subject but Geoffrey tries his best."
Geoffrey McGregor,MAT188,"Oct 2nd, 2024",5.0,3.0,"Honestly the GOAT of math profs at UofT. Very patient, very concise and his lectures are very engaging."
Geoffrey McGregor,MAT188,"Sep 29th, 2024",5.0,3.0,"Amazing teacher honestly, makes course content make sense."
Geoffrey McGregor,MAT186,"Sep 26th, 2024",5.0,3.0,I had him for both 186 and 187. Although the content was hard and I did not do the best in MAT186 he is a very good professor who incorporates more than just reading off sides. He gives us practice problems and goes around the room helping students individually with the problem. His office hours are also amazing. 10/10 would take again.
Geoffrey McGregor,MAT188,"Apr 13th, 2024",5.0,4.0,Great teacher
Geoffrey McGregor,MAT186,"Dec 14th, 2023",5.0,4.0,He makes calculus less hard. Good teacher who paces his lecture really nicely.
Geoffrey McGregor,MAT188,"Dec 14th, 2023",5.0,3.0,Geoff is a really cool prof who made early morning lectures manageable. 10/10 recommend.
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Jan 13th, 2025",4.0,4.0,"Shai kinda just teaches whatever he wants during lectures, often going on long tangents that have nothing to do with the course. This works well for developing an appreciation for the nuances of math, but not for midterm/exam prep. Otherwise, he teaches very well, and is overall a very nice person. Shai is the father figure I wish I had growing up."
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"Jan 7th, 2025",1.0,5.0,Never reply and never communicate
Shai Cohen,APS163,"Jan 4th, 2025",3.0,4.0,"I had calc II with Shai as an online course with no lectures and online weekly hour-ish tutorials. The exam format was so that about half of the questions would have sub-questions in them, each related to the answer you got from the previous one. You would lose the entire mark if you didn't know how to solve the first sub-question."
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Dec 10th, 2024",3.0,4.0,"Shai is nice for inspirational speeches and the sort, but it's difficult to learn in his class. I feel bad for saying it because he's such a genuinely funny and amazing guy, but he often goes off topic to talk abt political and societal stuff in lectures. Not saying that it's bad, but having that happen right before the midterm is crazy..."
Shai Cohen,APS163,"Dec 5th, 2024",4.0,4.0,"The professor has a distinctive teaching style, requiring active engagement from students. The course is challenging, but the pre-recorded videos and Unstuck AI can be helpful for study prep. Consistent effort is key to success in this class."
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Oct 8th, 2024",5.0,4.0,Interesting lecture. Benificial.
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"Sep 19th, 2024",5.0,1.0,"Prof Cohen is an excellent and entertaining professor. He understand the high school math teachings and helps us translate university math into understandable information. He takes his time to make his lectures entertaining and uses synonyms for most of the course topics. Overall, a great prof."
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"Jul 2nd, 2024",1.0,3.0,Hardly focuses on the material and goes on tangents. Also frankly does not care for his students concerns within the course as he does not respond on pizzia and does not give a clear indication of marking scheme.
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"May 18th, 2024",1.0,5.0,He is bad
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"May 7th, 2024",1.0,5.0,Confusing marking scheme and returns mark towards the end of the course. Thus through the majority of the course you barely have a idea of where you stand.
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"May 7th, 2024",1.0,5.0,Often gets side track and does a poor job of delving deep into material. Had to rely on just past notes posted other calculus teachers to achieve a good mark rather than his teaching.
Shai Cohen,APS163,"Jan 21st, 2024",3.0,4.0,"Always answers students' questions and makes lectures entertaining. The assignments are challenging but he gives great tips about them if you attend his office hours. His pre-recorded videos are very helpful, although some sections aren't as detailed. Wish he went through more examples during the lecture and his exams are very tough. Solid prof!!"
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Jan 11th, 2024",3.0,4.0,"BIG UPS PROF. COHEN. HE ALWAYS STANDS ON BIDNESS WHENEVER SOMEONE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CLASS TRIES TO ENTER MID LECTURE.
Teachingwise, his lecture were okay for me personally, they can sometimes be confusing since he loves delving deep into proofs. However if you are genuinely interested in math, I dont think there's a better prof out there."
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Jan 8th, 2024",5.0,3.0,"Great Prof, or I should say one of the best in Faculty of Eng. I like his lectures soo much."
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Jan 8th, 2024",5.0,4.0,"Before lectures, go through Pre/Post Class Readings. Lecture will be very proof-based and theoretical if you don't. Shai Cohen is the GOAT"
Shai Cohen,APS163,"Jan 8th, 2024",5.0,5.0,"Great Prof, I really like his lectures. Yet the homework and the exam is just way too hard and way too ""interesting""."
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Jan 8th, 2024",4.0,5.0,"Shai cohen is a great guy. I liked that he took personal responsibility for giving us non-course-related advice. Now his lectures are quite difficult to understand, but this course is admittedly highly abstract. You either love him or you unfortunately just can't understand his lectures. Overall, great guy, you lucked out if you got him."
Shai Cohen,APS163,"Dec 17th, 2023",5.0,4.0,"Mad hard final exams but there's always a juicy curve! One of the funniest and most approachable professors I know, takes the effort to get to know some students by name which is very sweet."
Shai Cohen,APS163,"Nov 25th, 2023",5.0,5.0,My goat. Came to university in hopes of finding professors like him. He has so much depth of thought and really makes his students think. His class is difficult but in the best way possible. He forces students to unlock their full potential. Gives really interesting insight and talks to students as equal. Really engaging guy.
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Nov 24th, 2023",5.0,3.0,Undoubtedly the best prof in eng faculty
Shai Cohen,APS163,"Nov 24th, 2023",5.0,3.0,Absolutely amazing
Shai Cohen,APS163,"Aug 24th, 2021",5.0,3.0,Really chill dude and does loads of good examples in class to prepare the the exam. He is so knowledgeable about vertually all math concepts.
Shai Cohen,APS163,"Dec 16th, 2020",1.0,5.0,He just doesn't really help... You need a lot of initiative to figure it out yourself
Shai Cohen,APS163,"Nov 29th, 2020",5.0,5.0,Shai's a funny guy. Great videos. Its like he's sadistic or smthng with his exams. Doesn't think ahead.
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"Nov 13th, 2020",5.0,3.0,Super chill prof and very knowledgeable. Explains everything clearly
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Nov 4th, 2020",5.0,3.0,Best teaching experience by far.
Shai Cohen,APS163,"Oct 17th, 2020",5.0,4.0,"Professor Cohen gave very good lectures, and provided very good answers on piazza to all student questions (when another student didn't answer first). The assignments are VERY HARD but then comparitivly, the exam isn't so bad. Beware: if you take multiple classes with Professor Cohen, he can and will tell the exact same joke in each class."
Shai Cohen,APS163,"Oct 16th, 2020",1.0,5.0,"He assigns things and doesn't answer questions, very incompetent teacher!"
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"Sep 20th, 2020",5.0,3.0,His videos are particularly useful during COVID-19. Inspirational
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"Jun 21st, 2020",5.0,2.0,"incredibly inspiring, intelligent person with a great care for the success of students!"
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"Oct 15th, 2019",5.0,3.0,Shais my guy. Would not take again
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"May 28th, 2019",4.0,4.0,"Shai is very knowledgeable and teaches well, however he tends to go off topic a lot during class. But you're in good hands because his videos are very helpful and he curves a lot."
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"Apr 16th, 2019",5.0,3.0,Awesome dude. He's so consistent it's astonishing. Also funny
Shai Cohen,APS162,"Oct 6th, 2018",5.0,4.0,Incredible professor. If I could take every one of my courses with him I would.
Shai Cohen,CSC165,"Apr 30th, 2018",4.0,2.0,"Although the assignments are quite hard, but finally get curved a lot."
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Dec 15th, 2017",2.0,4.0,"Tends to go off topic nearly every lecture. Knows and understands material really well, however, not the greatest at explaining. Should've spent more times running through examples rather than ranting about Bahen."
Shai Cohen,MAT290,"Dec 2nd, 2016",3.0,4.0,Goes off topic every now and then on things that aren't related to the course. Office hours are alright if you can get to him. Tutorials are probably better for getting a grasp on material.
Shai Cohen,APS162,"Oct 9th, 2016",5.0,4.0,"I found his online lectures to be extemely clear and helpful, and Im taking him again for APS163 this semester. His in class MAT188 lectures are frusterating as he goes off topic, I may end up stopping attending his in class-lectures."
Shai Cohen,CSC165,"Aug 15th, 2016",1.0,4.0,"No help for students outside of his packed 1 hour office hour, says he will look at Piazza, the online forum used, but checks once a month. Insanely long times to mark (Still waiting over 2 months for our first problem set, along with problem set 2,3 and test 2 mark ). I do not recommend taking a class with him."
Shai Cohen,CSC165,"Aug 6th, 2016",5.0,4.0,"Shai's teaching is very inspirational. As for the difficulty, it's actually easier than my eco206 class."
Shai Cohen,CSC165,"Aug 2nd, 2016",5.0,4.0,"I'd like to say despite how the summer course was ran,  he was a wonderful and phenomenal professor. He really showed me the true spirit of mathematical thinking (and actually got me of all people to like it). The course itself though isn't supposed to be too hard (or interesting for that matter), but Shai defied all of that. Would take him again!"
Shai Cohen,CSC236,"Jul 27th, 2016",1.0,5.0,its like he grades to see how many marks he can take off
Shai Cohen,CSC236,"Jul 20th, 2016",1.0,5.0,i've never thought this course can be hard like this
Shai Cohen,CSC236,"Jul 19th, 2016",1.0,5.0,"Problem sets are just nightmare, midterm as well. The marking speed is slowest I have ever seen. I should not take this course at summer."
Shai Cohen,CSC236,"Jul 13th, 2016",1.0,5.0,Barely teaches anything then makes overly difficult term tests and assignments. Little to no practice or preparation given for them. Tutorial and quiz material is ahead of the lectures or he teaches on the day of. ONE office hour for two big classes. Rarely comes on Piazza. Doesn't respond to his emails. Still don't have Problem Set 1 marks.
Shai Cohen,CSC165,"Jul 13th, 2016",1.0,5.0,"""I am English Major"", he said. He work for Mathmathtica Department, but teach CSC165. Useless lecture, so much irrevalent boring story. So many mistakes on problem set. Waste your tuition. The exam is extremely hard, he believes that most people should not be able to complete all the question. DO NOT TAKE HIS COURSE. ITS JUST BAD."
Shai Cohen,CSC165,"Jul 13th, 2016",1.0,5.0,"the term test is just a nightmare, i am impressed by that he really teaches nothing during lectures and makes the test incredibly hard and we don't  even have enough time to finish it ."
Shai Cohen,CSC236,"Jul 13th, 2016",1.0,4.0,"If you're thinking about taking his class -- stop, do not enroll.  In summary: 1) Lectures are complete disorganized and unrelated to the course content. 2) Shai has little to none time to support students. 3) No marks are posted until almost the final exam. 4) Tutorials are useless. 5) Problem Sets and Quizzes are full of errors."
Shai Cohen,CSC165,"Jul 8th, 2016",1.0,5.0,"Horrible, very bad experience, nightmare."
Shai Cohen,CSC165,"Jul 8th, 2016",1.0,5.0,"Very useless lectures, always telling some useless stories, and run out of the topic every single lecture.  Used to post the wrong answer for a question multiple times.  Marking is extremely slow, we haven't get back the first midterm even we are going to write the second midterm.  We don't even receive first problem set up to second one is due."
Shai Cohen,CSC236,"Jul 4th, 2016",1.0,4.0,"He recommanded to all students to sign up to Piazza(the discussion board).  In fact, he showed up to the discussion board in the first month only so there are many questions you posted on the discussion board left not answered. In his lectures, he often got off topics and talked something not important, but tests and assignments are harder."
Shai Cohen,APS163,"Apr 16th, 2016",1.0,5.0,His online videos are not clear. He specifies lots of unimportant steps. His words are weird and not related to the course sometimes.
Shai Cohen,MAT187,"Jan 11th, 2016",4.5,3.0,"So inspirational professor. His lectures are crystal-clear and he still somehow makes time to explain stuff in a very interesting, unorthodox way. Personally, I love his style of teaching."
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"Nov 25th, 2015",3.5,3.0,"Absolutely phenomenal Professor, He is a genius. However most students are not geniuses so you might find his lecture lacks clarity or his remarks off-topic sometimes."
Shai Cohen,APS162,"Sep 17th, 2015",4.5,3.0,Tough Exam
Shai Cohen,MAT187,"Mar 9th, 2015",3.5,5.0,Great prof. Really funny. Lots of stories. His tests are the hardest.
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"Jan 4th, 2015",4.5,2.0,Tells a lot of stories but his teaching abilities are amazing.
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"Dec 9th, 2014",3.5,3.0,He is a good teacher but he most of the time waste's our time with unrelated stories and examples of his life.
Shai Cohen,MAT187,"Apr 26th, 2014",1.5,3.0,"If you have him, the only thing I can say is good luck."
Shai Cohen,MAT290,"Jan 8th, 2013",1.0,2.0,"He's very unorganized, not prepared for every lecture. Topics are jumped from one to another without any clue. Makes easy topics seem harder. Bad prof"
Shai Cohen,CSC236,"Apr 19th, 2012",4.5,4.0,"One of my favorite professors at UofT. Really made me love everything about theoretical computer science. Doesn't read from the textbooks, tells jokes and anecdotes. Sometimes it feels more like philosophy than CS. Yea his assignments are hard and there's a lot of work. Study, ask questions; he's always there to help."
Shai Cohen,MAT197,"Apr 12th, 2012",4.0,5.0,"Extremely hard, feels at times like he's hard to show off how smart he is, but a skilled lecturer whose helpful during office hours."
Shai Cohen,MAT197,"Feb 2nd, 2012",5.0,2.0,This guy makes calculus more intuitive and exciting.
Shai Cohen,MAT197,"Jan 9th, 2012",4.0,4.0,"Very cool prof, super nice guy and totally enthusiastic. Tests are hard but the course is hard, so. Ask questions and do your homework and you'll be fine."
Shai Cohen,CSC236,"Dec 4th, 2011",5.0,3.0,"Awesome prof and tries hard to make the class good. Very passionate about teaching and math. Yes, tests are a bit hard, but not too much more difficult than the tests in other courses. It's U of T. Definitely not a class to be missed."
Shai Cohen,MAT290,"Dec 2nd, 2011",5.0,3.0,"Best prof I've had at U of T so far. Made me actually interested in the material, instead of just learning and regurgitating formulas. Ask him questions if you don't understand something, and he'll do a great job of making sure you understand before he goes on. Sure, his tests are hard. Study."
Shai Cohen,MAT197,"Nov 9th, 2011",5.0,4.0,Excellent prof! Definitely one of the few great profs at U of T.
Shai Cohen,CSC236,"Nov 5th, 2011",3.5,5.0,"The highlight of my week!I love the fact that he gets off topic.I dont go to lecture to hear exactly what the textbook says.His classes are extremely interesting.The assignments and tests require understanding of the matterial,a bit of intelligence and some hard work.All those are easy enough if you are truly interested in math or cs!"
Shai Cohen,CSC247,"Nov 4th, 2011",3.0,5.0,"Great guy, awesome sense of humour, but assignments and tests will violently crush you. If you have a chance to attend his non-academic seminars, do so because he gives inspiring speeches. Other than that, steer clear of any course he's coordinating"
Shai Cohen,CSC165,"Oct 20th, 2011",2.0,5.0,Knows what he's talking about but unfortunately assumes it's just as easy for everyone else. Eloquent speaker but not comprehensible enough. Assignments were overly difficult and students had to figure out material on their own. Interesting guy but not my kind of teacher.
Shai Cohen,MAT197,"Sep 11th, 2011",2.5,5.0,"This was the hardest math course  I've ever taken, and I failed miserably. Make sure to have a good understanding of all concepts before the exam. And remember to pray for your life if Shai Cohen coordinates the course."
Shai Cohen,MAT237,"Jul 12th, 2011",1.0,3.0,Gets off topic
Shai Cohen,CSCS,"Apr 18th, 2011",2.0,5.0,His assignments are just tortures...
Shai Cohen,MAT197,"Mar 20th, 2011",1.5,5.0,"Disaster Professor! Why would the papers be so hard?! You should be in the Battle Of Math Professors making papers, not here in an undergrad university. Its a shame that so many people like me suffer because of him ""challenging"" you at exams. Failing don't make you learn, I swear."
Shai Cohen,CSC165,"Feb 12th, 2011",1.0,5.0,"Assignments are just for torture, even the other prof in the course said the assignment is unfair."
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Feb 2nd, 2011",5.0,5.0,Great prof.  Extremely challenging but also very inspiring.
Shai Cohen,MAT325,"Dec 23rd, 2010",4.5,3.0,He really loves what he does and it shows!
Shai Cohen,MAT197,"Aug 23rd, 2010",3.5,5.0,"Failed 197, hardest course I have ever taken. By no means am I blaming him for my poor performance, but the averages were consistently low. During 196 there was a cheating incident and with just my luck I had a ""suspicious"" exam. I felt that he was pushing me to take the fall just to make himself look better. Luckily it all worked out just fine."
Shai Cohen,MAT197,"May 13th, 2010",1.5,5.0,"I failed his first year course, MAT197. I should have studied harder. Cohen is more difficult to understand than other professors. The common complaint is he thinks everyone is as smart as himself. The class average was a 55.5 before the final... but admittedly I was lower. It's a hard course, remember."
Shai Cohen,MAT197,"Apr 18th, 2010",2.0,5.0,"Useless. As a professor he's okay. Not the best, but not the worst. As a course coordinator he's terrible. He makes the hardest tests. His first test was rediculous, so he promised to make the second test easier to make up for it. The next one was even harder. He'd rather crush you then test you on anything remotely useful."
Shai Cohen,MAT197,"Apr 13th, 2010",1.0,5.0,Absolutely useless professor and tests are overly difficult
Shai Cohen,MAT197,"Apr 13th, 2010",1.0,5.0,awful prof
Shai Cohen,MAT197,"Apr 8th, 2010",2.5,4.0,"The class average before the final exam was 57%........... that is the worst average I have ever seen for any class in first year. His tests are super hard and he says he's going to make them easier, then after everyone is destroyed by it, he says ""Whoopsy Daisy, wtv we can just bellcurve 5-6% later"""
Shai Cohen,MAT197,"Mar 5th, 2010",2.0,4.0,Useless
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Dec 17th, 2009",1.0,4.0,"He taught 188 and 186, omg was he mind boggling.  Very philosophical, abstract, only people very passionate of math would enjoy his class.  Not clear at explaining things, and never used examples.  Pretty disappointing as he seemed like a nice guy."
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"Dec 15th, 2009",2.0,3.0,"I found him very interesting, but I didn't learn very much. He was constantly digressing and it seemed as though he was more interested in impressing his students than teaching them. He seems like a fair marker though."
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Dec 15th, 2009",4.0,4.0,Really encourages students to go beyond what's expected
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"Dec 15th, 2009",5.0,1.0,"Topics include: Proving that baseball isn't a sport with math, Using logic to show that Baba O'Reilly is Teenage Wasteland, bad jokes, good jokes, and still getting all the info (and more) across. Had him for two courses. Comes across best if you're already good or interested in mathematics."
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Dec 12th, 2009",2.0,4.0,very vague...
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Dec 9th, 2009",1.0,5.0,"The first day of class, he told us he ends up with more students at end of term. Not true this yr. At least 50% of the class is gone, flooding to other prof's lectures. It is difficult to comprehend his speech (even tho you understand it) and his writings. You will need to work 3 times harder to understand the material from him. Play 4D tictactoe:S"
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Dec 9th, 2009",1.0,5.0,Professor Cohen would show up to class 30 minutes late and take up the rest talking bout his day or why he was late. He never used examples and finished the course early. On the last day he was 40 minutes late and didn't do any review.
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"Dec 8th, 2009",2.5,5.0,"Does barely enough examples. justifies his laziness through ""efficiency"". he expects you to read before lectures. his classes are more like discussions about the material. He would be an excellent philosophy teacher."
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Dec 5th, 2009",4.0,4.0,Very Good
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"Dec 4th, 2009",2.5,2.0,"A funny guy, but not a very great teacher in my opinion."
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Nov 30th, 2009",1.0,3.0,Really.... it seems that his teaching skills just went down the drain. He does not give a rat's crap about whether we understand the content and he just keeps on going and going and going....
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"Aug 5th, 2008",5.0,4.0,"AMMMMAZING GUY!!! Got >65 in high school calc, 80 in his class. Not easy though..."
Shai Cohen,MAT197,"Jul 29th, 2008",5.0,4.0,Great guy and a great prof. Extremely clear and easy to understand. Will make you actually like math. His tests are quite challenging however!
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Apr 9th, 2008",5.0,2.0,"got a lotta rules.. but lectures are crystal clear. answers are very good, got a great sense of humour"
Shai Cohen,MAT197,"Mar 4th, 2008",5.0,4.0,"Too bad I suck at Calculus, so much so that even an absolutly fantastic professor still couldn't even help me."
Shai Cohen,MAT197,"Feb 25th, 2008",3.0,3.0,"To be honest, he will focus more on his life than the course. He speaks clearly, but he teaches to ""prove"" he knows this stuff, but not to embue that knowledge to his students"
Shai Cohen,MAT196,"Jan 8th, 2008",5.0,1.0,"Best Professor I had in first year by far. Also the only professor I had who fully understood questions in lecture and was able to answer them in a clear, concise manner. His insights into life are even more intriguing than the math you will learn with him."
Shai Cohen,MAT188,"Dec 5th, 2007",5.0,3.0,"He's Great. I'm glad I didn't miss a single lecture! (Ok, i missed one, but that's it!)... try searching ""Shai Cohen"" on google. You'll find some very curious pictures... hehehe... just do it. You'll see what I mean"
Shai Cohen,MAT186,"May 8th, 2007",4.5,3.0,"Great prof. Funny, doesn't just rattle off notes."
Shai Cohen,MAT237,"Oct 6th, 2006",2.5,3.0,"he's really a good at teaching, but only what he's interested in. During 237 we learned about the foundations of modern set theory, logic, and elements of analysis leading to modern differential geometry instead of what was on the curicullum. This sucked when the test came around."
Shai Cohen,MAT237,"Jul 17th, 2006",2.0,1.0,Unless you want to learn 257 don't take this course with him.
Shai Cohen,MAT223,"May 16th, 2006",3.0,2.0,"Rewrites all proofs which are already in the txtbk. Explains badly and with accent. Cannot distinguish Rn and Rm, which makes linear transformation impossible to learn."
Shai Cohen,MAT237,"Apr 14th, 2006",2.5,5.0,"He doesn't teach us what we're supposed to be taught but rather stuff that he finds interesting, which REALLY sucks for when test time comes around (since there are different profs in this course). He also said ""If you're not failing students you might as well go around kicking homeless people."" Take what you will from that..."
Shai Cohen,MAT223,"Mar 15th, 2006",3.5,4.0,"He is a good professor, he has a sense of humor, he understands the material very well and puts it in ""big picture"" context. But, he can be hard to follow. I felt that he expected too much from the students in terms of understanding the material fast. If you are a strong student, then I think he will be a good professor for you."
Shai Cohen,MAT223,"Oct 28th, 2005",3.5,4.0,[ accent ] + [ tough math theorems ] = [ failure ]
Shai Cohen,MAT223,"Oct 16th, 2005",3.0,3.0,"Looks hot, sounds hot, acts hot!"
Shai Cohen,MAT237,"Oct 6th, 2005",5.0,3.0,"Excellent professor, he can joke around as your friend. Great personality and very helpful during his office hour"
Shai Cohen,MAT223,"Aug 18th, 2005",3.0,4.0,His notes are not too helpful because he focuses too much on unnecessary theorem proofs and not much examples were given. This seriously makes his lectures a mental torture. You can enter the lecture energetic but you get out exhausted. Try his office hours or go to Stanzack if you are struggling.
Shai Cohen,MAT223,"Jun 15th, 2005",5.0,2.0,I think he is nice beyond nice. and I love his voice
Shai Cohen,MAT237,"May 25th, 2005",5.0,3.0,Great Prof....quite cocky but can be a good thing
Shai Cohen,MAT223,"Mar 19th, 2005",5.0,2.0,"One of the best profs at UofT. Thanks to him i was able to actually understand what was going on. He actually tries to explain all the concepts, not just writing some examples from the textbook."
Shai Cohen,MAT135,"Feb 28th, 2005",5.0,3.0,"I had him as a TA way back when. All around great guy, and great teacher."
Shai Cohen,MAT223,"Dec 10th, 2004",2.0,5.0,personality is pretty. lecture is ugly. together is pretty ugly.
Shai Cohen,MAT135,"Oct 25th, 2004",5.0,3.0,I enjoyed every minute of his classes. Some people thought his comments were arrogant but he lightens things up for us and tries to teach it to us so we can like it AND learn it. I appreciate his extra efforts when asked.
Shai Cohen,CSC236,"Sep 15th, 2004",4.5,3.0,"Great prof. Tests are fair, has a sense of humour, explains concepts clearly."
Shai Cohen,MAT135,"Jul 20th, 2004",4.5,4.0,"If all profs were more like Dr.Cohen, we'd all be in a better situation at U of T, I think. If you ask for it, he'll help you, whatever it takes. And he speaks English, a new concept it seems in this department."
Shai Cohen,CSC236,"Jun 14th, 2004",2.5,3.0,ALRIGHT
Shai Cohen,CSC238,"Jun 7th, 2004",4.0,2.0,Good prof....with fair tests.....reasonably hard with minimum expectations from students....
Shai Cohen,CSC236,"Feb 28th, 2004",1.5,4.0,"smarter-than-you attitude, lack of enthusiasm in course material, and obvious feeling of great self-importance adds up to one terrible prof."
Shai Cohen,CSC236,"Feb 26th, 2004",4.0,3.0,"Obviously knows his stuff and how to communicate it, and I love his intelligent humour. But who wouldn't like a guy who can bring CompSci and Shakespeare into one room!"

Shai Cohen,MAT135,"Jul 21st, 2003",5.0,4.0,"This guy is the main reason i passed this course! he is the MOST patient, humble teacher i have EVER met! (prob it helps if you are sincerely trying to get help too...) very smart. and amusing.  he was a TA tho, not a prof"
Shai Cohen,CSC238,"Aug 27th, 2002",1.0,4.0,kinda difficult to understand him at times
Shai Cohen,COS220,"Aug 21st, 2002",1.0,5.0,Horrible accent. Stop drinking Coke and teach us something

Shai Cohen,CSC238,"May 3rd, 2002",4.0,3.0,induction prove my azz
Shai Cohen,CSC238,"May 2nd, 2002",2.5,5.0,he is nice.. but the course still sucks
Shai Cohen,CSC238,"May 1st, 2002",3.0,3.0,he's really lame at times....238 stinks
Shai Cohen,CSC238,"Mar 22nd, 2002",3.0,5.0,"Nice and helpful guy, but pretty useless notes/lectures."
Shai Cohen,CSC238,"Nov 26th, 2001",4.0,3.0,"Very cool guy, but csc238 still stinks."
Camelia Karimian Pour,MAT188,"Nov 25th, 2024",3.0,4.0,"The prof definitely knows what they're talking about and can answer questions well, but I found the lectures were often very chaotic and overcrowded."
Camelia Karimian Pour,MAT188,"Nov 15th, 2024",5.0,4.0,Amazing lectures. They are always so full that people stand at the walls to listen to the lecture.
Camelia Karimian Pour,MAT187,"Apr 11th, 2024",5.0,2.0,"Her office hours are truly amazing. Don't miss them at alllll. She is very nice and approachable.
The mathematical communication using English was the most stupid and useless thing in her course but other than that enjoy!!"
Camelia Karimian Pour,MAT188,"Jan 8th, 2024",5.0,3.0,"She saved my entire year group in Linear Algebra. She seems to have such an incredible grasp of the concepts she's teaching and it shows. Amazing lectures and explanations, just an incredible professor to have for this class. My only concern is that sometimes the lectures are easier than the midterms and exams so you do need to be careful."
Camelia Karimian Pour,MAT187,"May 11th, 2023",5.0,2.0,"PCE improved a lot from last semester. Tutorials made revolutionary changes where students didn't have to struggle every Q from the assigned doc. I can hardly spot a seat for her lecture sections since she explained things extremely clear and concise using step-to-step method with various external math tools. Exam-override system was dupe, amazing!"
Camelia Karimian Pour,MAT188,"Jan 27th, 2023",5.0,5.0,"Camelia is a good professor who clearly understands the course material well. In her office hours and lectures, she explains things well. The difficulty stems not from herself, but the insane amount of work we had. We had WebWork, written homework, tutorial worksheets, MATLAB exercises and assigments, and reflections, which was super overwhelming."
Camelia Karimian Pour,MAT188,"Jan 14th, 2023",5.0,3.0,"Extremely good at teaching concepts, and lectures are very active and engaging. She is really good at explaining concepts and if you are ever stuck, she is a godsend during office hours. Really cares about the success of her students and is really kind and extremely organized."
Denis Gorodkov,MAT188,"Jan 15th, 2025",5.0,3.0,"Go Denis! 
Great prof with amazing lectures (although more theoretical than practical). Very nice, helpful and always eager to help."
Denis Gorodkov,MAT224,"Jan 8th, 2025",5.0,3.0,"He was an incredible professor who cared deeply about mathematics and teaching. It was a fun environment to learn in, and it was clear that he wanted to help students. His office hours were also very helpful and engaging, making the course so much more enjoyable."
Denis Gorodkov,MAT188,"Jan 5th, 2025",5.0,2.0,"Best prof :) 
He actually looks at the feedback board, so if you want to anonymously ask him to change something about his lectures, he will talk about it at the beginning of the lectures and ask which method people prefer. As long as you ask for assistance, Denis is there to help :)))"
Denis Gorodkov,MAT224,"Jan 5th, 2025",5.0,2.0,"There was no MAT188 tag but that's the class I had him for. He's amazing with making sure students always understand the material, even staying long after lectures standing outside in the cold and dark to make sure we would do well on the midterm. I had the 5-6 pm lectures and could have easily skipped it, but I went every time just for Denis!!"
Denis Gorodkov,MAT224,"Dec 15th, 2024",5.0,3.0,"Professor Gorodkov has great lectures and his office hours are even better! I had him for MAT188 which is engineering linear algebra and he was always so helpful during office hours and took the time to explain all concepts in detail. Very good lectures and he has great student hours! Very good at explaining concepts. If you have him, you're lucky!"
Denis Gorodkov,MAT224,"Nov 20th, 2024",5.0,3.0,"Hands down the best professor I have ever had at UofT. His lectures were extremely engaging and you could tell he really cared about his students. He organized two 3 hour long review sessions before the final exam, and he was always extremely willing to answer questions and re-explain concepts. I wish he taught every math course here. King."
Denis Gorodkov,MAT224,"Oct 18th, 2024",5.0,3.0,Best professor at UofT. Made the content very interesting and it felt worth it to go to his lectures. You can see that he genuinely cares about teaching students and he always answers any questions with so much effort and thought. Definitely go to his office hours because he explains problems and solutions very well!!
Denis Gorodkov,MAT224,"Sep 24th, 2024",5.0,2.0,"One of my favourite profs I've had at UofT, could not recommend more."
Denis Gorodkov,MAT224,"Jul 15th, 2024",5.0,3.0,"One the the most enthusiastic and caring profs i have ever seen. I was not originally in his section, but made an effort to get up at 9 for his lectures (it was that interesting)."
Denis Gorodkov,MAT224,"Jun 10th, 2024",5.0,3.0,"He is the best professor I have ever met in UofT. He has the best-organized Quercus page of all instructors. He is good at explaining abstract theorems with well-understand examples. In addition, he is willing to spend more time with students after the lecture. His office hours are always popular that the office is crowded with students every time."
Denis Gorodkov,MAT224,"May 10th, 2024",5.0,2.0,"The best professor, he cares about students and is willing to spend his time to help. He also did an amazing job of explaining abstract concepts with interesting examples in the lectures. I would definitely take his lecture again if I have the chance."
Denis Gorodkov,MAT224,"Apr 23rd, 2024",5.0,3.0,"Such a good prof. Explains concepts in a really good way, is one of the only profs in 224 that actually provides students with material outside of the lecture. He literally has a website dedicated to this course."
Denis Gorodkov,MAT224,"Mar 20th, 2024",5.0,3.0,He is so caring and his lecture is so good that I still force myself to go to his 9am lecture while extremely sleep deprived.
Denis Gorodkov,MAT224,"May 8th, 2023",5.0,3.0,This professor can explain some of the most complex things in the course to the point where you can understand it. He is also very caring and is willing to spend extra time with you. He is easily the best professor ive had so far
Denis Gorodkov,MAT224,"Apr 11th, 2023",5.0,3.0,"Denis is the most caring professor I have met in UofT! He gives students confidence to ask questions, and when you are falling behind on your schoolwork, he will take the time to guide you step-by-step outside of class. As long as you are communicating with him, you will have the best MAT224 experience!"
Denis Gorodkov,MAT224,"Mar 9th, 2023",5.0,3.0,This professor provides a lot of material that clearly explains material in textbook and is always able to easily answer any questions that appear throughout the lecture. Would definitely recommend him.
Denis Gorodkov,MAT224,"Mar 6th, 2023",5.0,3.0,"Only prof i've met that cares about students, seriously inspires you to want to complete the course work and succeed. Makes boring content interesting. You have to learn the course material and basics by yourself with the textbook (not that difficult to do), and he'll recap in lecture and show you why its exciting with cool sample problems."
Denis Gorodkov,MAT224,"Mar 3rd, 2023",5.0,3.0,"An amazing prof. A very nice and humorous guy, and is the only MAT224 prof who organizes contents into PPT slides. These slides are very helpful, organized and detailed. He has accent when speaking English, but it is a minor issue and not hard to understand."
Krzysztof Ciosmak,mat188,"Jan 9th, 2025",1.0,4.0,"This prof was absolutely horrible. He is not good at explaining and almost everyone stopped showing up to his lectures a few weeks in. I recommend either going to other lecture sections, any other prof is good. Or, rely on the PCEs, but beware they are worded badly. Just copy and paste onto chatgpt and tell it to reword it and explain better."

Dinushi Munasinghe,MAT188,"Dec 24th, 2024",5.0,3.0,"I didn't have her but when preparing for the MAT188 final, I went to her office hours and she was really sweet, and caring, and always tried her best. She was also really personable and made studying for linear algebra a lot more fun. She also put a lot of effort into making handouts to help student out with studying, which I really appreciated."
Dinushi Munasinghe,MAT188,"Dec 10th, 2024",5.0,4.0,"I love her so much! She is such a hilarious, caring prof. She literally spent hours staying up making a review booklet for us that goes over the entire course, with definitions and fill-in-the-blank questions. She explains concepts so clearly in her 'vibey notes'. I'm not even in her section lol but her lectures >>>> 

She's so unbothered queen LOL"
Dinushi Munasinghe,MAT188,"Nov 18th, 2024",5.0,2.0,"Great prof. She is one of the funniest teachers I've had since elementary school hands down. She dumbs down the concepts really well using familiar analogies that a toddler can understand. And while it may not get you marks on a test, they make the concepts click. She goes above and beyond to ensure the success of her students. Always read PCEs."
Dinushi Munasinghe,MAT188,"Nov 13th, 2024",5.0,2.0,Dinushi oh Dinushi where do I begin? Absolutely the goat professor right now. She is extremely helpful and will go above and beyond to help her students understand. She'll stay back till even midnight just to help the few students who need it. Her lectures are very engaging too. She's great at her job and I would 100% recommend.
Dinushi Munasinghe,MAT188,"Nov 12th, 2024",5.0,1.0,she is defently the best prof ever. i would compare her to luka doncic tbh. she litterly stayed up to 11:30 pm on campus to make sure i understand the lin alg midterm for today and guess what I AM NOT COOKED (i think idk we will see). but seriously she explained the concepts to me so well and honestly shes super chill. like i said 10/10.
Dinushi Munasinghe,MAT188,"Dec 6th, 2021",4.0,4.0,"Solid prof, just make sure you do the PCEs and read up on the topic a little bit beforehand so you understand what she's saying. Seems like a very chill person overall."
Dinushi Munasinghe,MAT188,"Dec 1st, 2021",5.0,4.0,I was with Vardan Papyan for the first 2 months of my first semester but eversince i discovered her online lectures I fell in love with her teaching style. She is super approachable and covers all the theory in detail. You don't even need to go through the wacky textbook after attending her lectures! Change your MAT188 professor today to Dinushi!
Dinushi Munasinghe,MAT223,"Sep 20th, 2021",1.0,3.0,"Vindictive and will not be open at all to re-grading, no matter how absurd the marking was or even if it is clear the marking was wrong / unfair. Concepts and material are not tested well, rather its multiple choice where there are multiple answers and if you miss one you're 0%. Past tests provided often have mistakes in them. Avoid at all costs."
Dinushi Munasinghe,MAT223,"Mar 1st, 2021",5.0,3.0,Great prof. Super kind and explains things in detail. Would def take again for a future course.
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Jan 18th, 2025",1.0,5.0,Don't choose his class if possible... there's a serious lack of content in this class.
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Jan 17th, 2025",5.0,3.0,Very good professor and course. Way too many complainers here. Only thing is that the instructors could be more responsive on Piazza but other than that it was a great course.

We did NOT touch a single ODE until probably the sixth week of class. Homeworks are very weird, group test of 12 items that counted for 20% of your grade, this course is a big waste of time."
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 26th, 2024",1.0,4.0,"Assignments are marked like it's MAT157, but there are no proofs/marking rubric is unclear. He is defensive to any student requests/criticism. On piazza, he responds passive aggressively, with claims like 'any applied math course is not taught by serious people'. I hope they never let you teach any serious math course, you deeply unserious person."
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 21st, 2024",1.0,2.0,"Bro literally taught the class like high school, don't take this course. Mostly worked with Microsoft Excel instead of solving ODEs, and there were group tests."
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 20th, 2024",1.0,1.0,Run Run Run Run !!!!
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 19th, 2024",1.0,5.0,"Do not take course of this professor or the course he coordinated. strictly no curve, the course structure is very poor and unorganized. I took intro to ODE and by the end of the semester I still don't know how to solve ode properly because he never taught us math. All we are doing is modeling and excel.. it doesn't prepare at all for PDE next year"
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 16th, 2024",1.0,5.0,"This is the most poorly structured course I have taken at UofT. It is unclear why the university keep hire such a professor. The refusal to implement a curve or make adjustments, despite many students clearly needing them. Also, the group portion of the midterm felt entirely random and lacked proper preparation or reference materials."
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 16th, 2024",2.0,4.0,"His teaching approach is totally different, as it focuses more on applications like Excel rather than  analytical method.  Personally, I believe that the idea of holding group tests, particularly for midterms or exams, is problematic. While collaboration is valuable in certain aspects, I don't think it's appropriate for high-stakes assessments."
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 16th, 2024",1.0,5.0,"Please don't take his courses... we did the minimal amount of integrals in an ODE course, and the whole course is purely based on Excel, group projects, and simulations instead of analytically solving for ODEs. The group portions and the midterm were also very tough and he didn't give any curvings and adjustments."
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 16th, 2024",1.0,5.0,"100% trash. Like to give grades over 10+ 20+ and it's very easy to lose marks. Get a 50% or 60% in your grade, including hw and tests (both individual and group), is very easy. No relation with math, purely excel class."
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 16th, 2024",1.0,4.0,"Don't take this class. I put in a lot of effort into my learning, went to all the lectures, and did well on the individual assignments/exams, but my average was dragged down by the group assignments, which are worth a lot. I'm disappointed because we didn't study most of the material in the textbook, we basically only did Excel, no actual math."
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 14th, 2024",1.0,5.0,"Do not take this professor's course. so difficult, we need to more  curve. His mid average is 42!!!!!!!!!!"
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 11th, 2024",1.0,5.0,"Firstly, DON'T CHOOSE THIS PROF'S COURSE! The homework grades are ridiculous, even though your answer is correct, but TA would minus the grade on very little things which are unnecessary. Learned nothing in the lecture, excel is useless in ODE. The group test can not be understood. All of the contents in this course are ridiculous."
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 9th, 2024",1.0,5.0,very hard not any curve very mean average 42 fkkkkk
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 8th, 2024",1.0,2.0,I learned nothing from the course. He also treats the class like high school/elementary school kids. Also obsessed with forcing people into groups for midterms and final.
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 8th, 2024",1.0,5.0,DON'T TAKE HIS COURSEEEE
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 8th, 2024",1.0,5.0,"After midterm scores came out, he adjusted the syllabus: splitting the final into group and individual parts and letting the final score replace the midterm if higher. We welcomed it at first, but the group final shocked us with unfamiliar questions. When asked about a curve on Piazza, he refused."

Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 7th, 2024",2.0,4.0,"So much excel, why? Is it the way that Math should be?"
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 4th, 2024",1.0,5.0,"I never thought that this math course was completely different from the same course taken by previous students. Why do we have to add group sections in the exam, and why do we require Excel modeling?"
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Dec 1st, 2024",3.0,2.0,"While this new edition of MAT244 isn't for those taking pure mathematics, it is a breath of fresh air compared to the other 200-level math courses. The teaching sometimes feels like high school, but Prof. Siefken is a nice person, and is easily approachable. Probably a course for those in the applied mathematics fields (e.g. economics, physics)"
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Nov 20th, 2024",1.0,5.0,He always discuss the topic related to homework AFTER the homework deadline.
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Nov 20th, 2024",1.0,2.0,"Terrible experience with this course. Lectures are so, so slow and we spend so much time doing Excel. Even have to use Excel during the group exams (why do these even exist).
11 weeks in and we haven't learned how to analytically solve anything rather than separable ODEs.
Doesn't even teach most of the stuff that was in the course description."
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Nov 15th, 2024",1.0,5.0,"Professor Siefken's MAT244 class caters to economics, statistics and business students who use excel and constant visualization to understand concepts. However, this is not a class that is required or even recommended for these majors. Students taking this course should not go to lectures in order to avoid confusion and read the textbook instead."
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Nov 1st, 2024",1.0,4.0,"Hands down the worst prof I've ever had for any course. The way the class is structured is a joke. We're forced to self-study to solve any homework problem, he's taught nothing about solving ODEs and has proved no theorems in class. He also treats you with a condescending demeanor and brushes you off when you try to ask a question after class."
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Oct 30th, 2024",1.0,5.0,"He doesn't actually ""teach"" any of the concepts. I'll get assigned a problem set and have to study on my own because he didn't actually teach us how to solve anything. He seems like a great guy but man he ruined this course."
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Oct 30th, 2024",1.0,3.0,Weird teaching and ta isnt helpful at all
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Oct 23rd, 2024",1.0,5.0,He never teach any definitions or theorems in his lecture.
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Oct 23rd, 2024",1.0,5.0,He does not tell us any definition in his lecture.
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Oct 21st, 2024",1.0,5.0,"We have done absolutely nothing in lecture other than make models for random scenarios, followed by ""now you guys take 10 mins and model this on excel"". With the intention of catering to the losers in non math fields who need to learn modeling for their programs, ""Professor"" Siefken reworked this course from a normal ode course to this slop."
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Oct 16th, 2024",1.0,3.0,"Course structure is beyond terrible. Most of lectures are spent discussing Excel spreadsheets. This is an ODE class, not an Excel class. Seems like it is catered more towards physics/other students than to actual mathematics students. Group component on midterm in a math course tells you all you need to know about his ""innovative"" teaching style"
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Oct 14th, 2024",1.0,5.0,how hard ?
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Oct 9th, 2024",1.0,5.0,Annoying and teaches useless information. Did not even do actual math
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Oct 8th, 2024",5.0,2.0,"In terms of lectures, it's pretty helpful that Prof. Siefken asks us to collaborate with other students and share our ideas. That helps a lot in terms of understanding stuff. Layout of the course changed and we're dealing with excel which is great for learning real life skills, nice change of pace from regular math courses"
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Oct 7th, 2024",1.0,5.0,"No concepts, just Excel and Desmos"
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Oct 7th, 2024",1.0,3.0,"Assignments are marked super strictly while the questions don't ask for rigour, in an almost deceptive way. The midterm has a group/collaborative portion. In a math course. He is also condescending in response to students' concerns, saying students are complaining on purpose to attention grab, and that we should be like Abe Lincoln lol"
Jason Siefken,MAT135,"Oct 5th, 2024",5.0,2.0,"Great Prof for 135, prop the most inspiring"
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Oct 5th, 2024",5.0,3.0,Best Prof ever for me ; absolutely loved him
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Oct 5th, 2024",1.0,1.0,"Seems like he uses AI to grade assignments, they are not looked at by a human. Terrible professor. Assignments have no correlation to material, are more Excel related than math related."
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Oct 5th, 2024",1.0,2.0,"Harsh grading, when the way to answer is unclear. Spends 90% of the lecture time on excel. We learn about trivial ODEs through reading textbook solely, might as well self study. This ODE course is made for those without interest in mathematics and not in any mathematics program. However, Professor Siefken is a nice person."
Jason Siefken,MAT244,"Sep 13th, 2024",2.0,3.0,"He overcomplicates easy topics. He forces students to discuss, and then leaves the correct solutions out in the air."
Jason Siefken,MAT335,"Dec 21st, 2023",5.0,2.0,"Amazing professor that cares a lot about pedagogy and how to teach students. Organizes lectures and assignments in a way that tells a story and leads you to make discoveries in math on your own.

Long essay instead of a final exam and lots of homework (half of which is simple programming in Python). Bonus marks for effort and showing you've tried."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Jun 5th, 2023",2.0,3.0,"He preaches student-centered learning, but he is so caught up in letting students struggle on a problem that he doesn't support actually reaching the answer. His lectures go over examples in his textbook, so if a concept didn't make sense in the reading it probably still won't in class. Calling on students for answers should be left in high school."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"May 29th, 2023",5.0,2.0,"Awesome professor. Assigns readings before lecture and teaches by going through examples from the textbook during every lecture. He is passionate about teaching and answers questions with enthusiasm. Highly recommend (it's also an easy course, especially with such a great professor)."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Apr 10th, 2023",5.0,2.0,He was so nice I would take more courses with him :) Overall very good prof
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Feb 2nd, 2023",1.0,2.0,"Overall, I feel that Siefken's class is not enjoyable. His MAT223 lectures do not discuss any of the concepts or give any intuition, and his teaching of this subject is much worse than previous courses in linear algebra I have taken. The way his textbook is integrated into lectures is good, although the textbook often has confusing explanations."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Dec 2nd, 2022",5.0,3.0,"wonderful prof! very approachable, knowledgeable, and interesting to talk to after class!"
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Oct 20th, 2022",5.0,3.0,"I love the atmosphere during his lecture. I can hardly learn anything from his textbook when studying on my own, but I can figure all the things out during his lecture. His lecture is very helpful. Linear Algebra is also very easy and he provides us with a lot of chances to get a considerable grade. Would take his other courses if possible."
Jason Siefken,MAT135H,"Aug 31st, 2022",5.0,2.0,a very good prof overall
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Jul 25th, 2022",1.0,2.0,"The class is awful, so it might just be its own fault. Then again, I think he made it."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Apr 6th, 2022",1.0,2.0,"Linear algebra is not very hard and the spring section was actually really easy. 65% of your grade was free. But learning sucks. His textbook is weird. It's not a standard order or way of teaching linear algebra, and certain common things (cross product...) are missing. Pretty wack overall."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Apr 6th, 2022",5.0,3.0,He is very enthusiastic about teaching and wants you to do really well in his class. Attending lectures is really useful since he wrote the textbook for the class and explains material you might not understand. I personally do really well in math when my professor really enjoys teaching the subject.
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Dec 31st, 2021",1.0,5.0,"Lazy professor. Doesnt actually teach anyhting useful in class, waste time and money assign questions for students to complete.. He also ignores piazza posts since he seems unwilling to help. He gives brutal exams with failing averages and never curves. His class is haunted afrter the first week. Worst course seen so far. Avoid him at all costs"
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Dec 30th, 2021",5.0,4.0,"Professor Siefken is one of my favourite teachers at U of T. His sense of humour and great interaction with students in the classroom attracted me a lot. Also, he is very patient when giving out suggestions and answers during office hours. Besides, he also gave me several suggestions not only in the field of Linear Algebra but also my personal life"
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Oct 24th, 2021",1.0,4.0,"regraded my first midterm ever to 2 marks lower, thanks Jason"
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Sep 16th, 2021",5.0,3.0,"Read the syllabus and the first few modules of the textbook. If you dislike the way they were written, then you probably won't like this course with Siefken. Pros: -Lectures are actually not useless -Textbook is not bloated -Exercises are insightful -Webwork is low effort practice Cons: -Perusall sucks"
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Apr 16th, 2021",3.0,4.0,"Siefken gets a bad rap for his ""accelerated"" section ofMAT223 20-21 Fall, but he wasn't terrible. Not his fault we had to learn a semester's worth of content in 6 weeks. He wasn't very accomodating and his grading policy was odd to say the least. But his course-specific textbook was good and he clearly knows the material very well. Not too bad!"
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Feb 5th, 2021",3.0,2.0,"MAT223 fall 2020 was kinda bird. The marking scheme requires intense participation which is fine by me. In fact, participation in a 10 min per week tutorial weighs 35% of the total mark. Very simple A. Siefken teaches well. He understands the concept and teaches them well. However, his textbook is actually horrendous, with useless sample problems."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Feb 4th, 2021",5.0,2.0,"I would say that his style of lecturing is not suited for everyone. He likes students participating and expects us to do our work beforehand. He doesn't give answers away and you really need to work for it, which imo is important when learning math. If you go to his office hours, he gives great feedback to your writeups and he rly knows his stuff."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Dec 30th, 2020",4.0,3.0,"I had almost no experience in linear algebra and found his methods to be helpful. Though he did assign a lot of homework, the load was manageable if you are organized. He does expect participation which promotes active recall + your questions won't get shut down. Attendance isn't mandatory but recommended since it's mainly practicing problems."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Dec 24th, 2020",3.0,2.0,"To do well in this course, you have to be motivated to read the chapters beforehand and try a few practice problems. The marking scheme was very fair this year with around half of it being basically annotations and participating during tutorials. Definitely not a course structure for those who have a difficult time self-learning."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Dec 23rd, 2020",1.0,1.0,This is seriously the most stupid format that you can learn math. Linear algebra can be a daunting subject especially if you have never taken anything like this before but rest assured Jason's self-written textbook will definitely make everything a hell lot harder. And guess what he force you to read and annotate it for marks too. DONT TAKE
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Dec 11th, 2020",4.0,2.0,"Prof Siefken does his research in teaching so he really cares about knowing how you're doing in his class. There's lots of homework in the course BUT it is all fairly easy and it makes MAT223 a course that is an average booster. Tests are very hard but only because they're worth a small portion of the mark. Personally, I loved being in his course."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Oct 31st, 2020",3.0,3.0,"Have you learned anything about linear algebra before? if yes, ignore this, you are good to go, caring, inspirational, and so on if not, then please be aware that this is not a bird course. Textbook used is written by the prof himself, wanna do well, definitely read it carefully. Why? Because he is teaching ""his"" linear algebra, not linear algebra."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Oct 19th, 2020",1.0,5.0,good professor but bad course coordinator. his course is so hard.
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Sep 11th, 2020",4.0,4.0,"The exam was hard, but his class is great. Passionate about teaching, require interaction, self-learning and read the textbook before. He would not explain everything during lecture, but If you carefully go through all the material he posted, it's not a big problem."
Jason Siefken,MAT335,"Jun 26th, 2020",5.0,2.0,"Jason's lectures follow his own course material that's pretty much written in the style of a textbook, and it is easy to do well in the course by simply following and understanding this material. He's a great teacher who cares about his student, and yet that could come in as a problem if you enjoy academic freedoms."
Jason Siefken,MAT335,"Apr 29th, 2020",1.0,2.0,"I got a 95 in this course and I feel like I didn't learn a thing. The homework exercises were either trivial or very hard, no inbetween. The grading scheme was bad: no part marks and all-or-nothing for each question; no feedback. At the depth at which we learned the material, the essays were pointless exercises in the use of the English language."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Apr 15th, 2020",1.0,3.0,Unbelievable. The first 20 minutes of your class is going to be him trying to inspire you. And he has this thought that he has to involve EVERYONE in lecture so he will call you out if you do not put your hand up or do not participate in discussions. Seems like he wanted to be an inspirational speaker than a math professor honestly. Did not learn.
Jason Siefken,MAT335,"Apr 5th, 2020",1.0,5.0,"One of the worst classes I've ever taken. Professor calls you out and embarrases you for things like not putting your hand up during a poll. No feedback on assignments, grading scheme for them is very unfair as it is all or none and strict. His response to this was, ""It's better to do a question and get 0 then to not do it at all"""
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Mar 22nd, 2020",5.0,3.0,"Having taken upwards of 40 half credits worth of courses at the St George campus, I can say that Professor Siefken is one of my favourite instructors that Ive encountered at the university. His lectures are engaging, and he has a genuine interest in mathematical education as a whole. Do the assigned problems and practice midterms - youll be fine."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Jan 17th, 2020",5.0,1.0,"Jason is amazing during lectures! The textbook is written by himself so he has a system of linear algebra inside his brain. The problems in textbooks are designed to improve you understanding, and Jason can explain one problem with multiple methods, which is truly incredible! Make sure to read textbook before lecture to participate in the journey!"
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Dec 13th, 2019",1.0,3.0,I read the comments on read my professor before and I originally thought people give him bad rating because they do not try hard.

Jason Siefken,MAT223,"May 3rd, 2019",2.0,5.0,He is a good professor just base on how he try to lead student to think. However it is more or less ridiculous that he doesn;t told you answer and want you to know everything. He bring the content in 224 to 223 and he teaches something that is different in mathmatical world! And he is always expecting people to memorize definition.
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Apr 23rd, 2019",5.0,3.0,"I think he is really nice! The lectures are inspiring and homework is not very heavy. He also gives practice tests which are quite similar to the actual tests. So if you really come to class and try hard, you wouldn't find this course as difficult as you think."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Apr 18th, 2019",5.0,1.0,lol
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Apr 5th, 2019",1.0,2.0,Very patronizing . He picks on students when a lot are shy and may have social anxiety this causes a lot of people to feel uncomfortable and not want to attend his lectures - given he is a course coordinator I would expect him to be more aware of his students given that uoft is suffering a mental health crisis .
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Mar 26th, 2019",1.0,5.0,Worst prof Ive ever seen. Not student friendly at all. Very uptight and arrogant
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Mar 22nd, 2019",4.0,2.0,I don't know why people find him so difficult. This is the easiest MAT course i've had so far. He basically gives you a practice test that is the same format as the real one. He's a great prof.
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Mar 3rd, 2019",1.0,3.0,"The stuff in lectures, textbook homework, and webwork don't match up well it is confusing to keep up with content. He will walk around and ask you questions if you're sitting alone or not talking when we're suppose to ""discuss.""

Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Feb 19th, 2019",5.0,4.0,"Easy grades? NO WAY! But that shouldn't deter you from taking this course with him. You won't receive easy answers or be taught mindless formulas.

If you work hard, you will succeed and genuinely LEARN!"
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Feb 5th, 2019",2.0,4.0,"His notes are helpful but I find he assigns too much to do outside of class, making more than half the course self-taught. We have daily homework, textbook questions, textbook readings, videos, and WebWork questions - much more than an average class."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Feb 3rd, 2019",1.0,4.0,"Horribly disorganized course coordinator. It's like taking 3 different courses: lectures, online work, textbook.

Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Apr 18th, 2018",1.0,5.0,"At the end of the semester, Professor Siefken wrote a long comment on Piazza outlining how he enjoyed teaching the course despite the course average is less than 60%, despite the fact that 70%+ people dropped. Arrogance, stubbornness, ignorance are the only qualities I see from this prof. He should approach Uppal and ask him how he ran the course."
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Apr 16th, 2018",1.0,5.0,Very unorganized.
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Apr 12th, 2018",1.0,5.0,Has a tunnel vision on how 224 needs to be run. He even wrote a long post at the end of the semester defending how he ran the course that just makes him look unapproachable and stubborn. Perhaps he should approach Uppal to see how he ran the course since theyre usually well reviewed.
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Apr 11th, 2018",1.0,5.0,"Terrible MAT224 coordinator. What is a class with a 70% drop rate? Refuses to reveal averages. Harsh grading and does not tell us what we did wrong on problem sets. Then, he puts a problem set question on the test and everyone gets it wrong."
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Apr 11th, 2018",1.0,5.0,"Coordinating MAT224 his reason for tunnel-visioning a course which started with 700 students and ended with 180 into the exam was that ""I talked to the other profs and agreed on a course syllabus"". TAs that dont show up consistently for OH, not revealing the average(40%) only for a more senior prof to leak it, and no solutions to HW problems ."
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Apr 11th, 2018",1.0,5.0,if you go to his office at pg there's blackboard beside his door saying 'the best prof'. people saying it just for ass kissing but pathetically seems like he truly believes it. im in his section hes always bouncing around and confuse people. stubborn and not willing to listen to others. no one messed up with him since they are still in the course.
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Apr 11th, 2018",1.0,5.0,hes always sending us email saying he works very hard on giving us a fair exam and hope we will appreciate his effort. its not fair just from this oneside call. look how it reflects on the students. everyone remained in the class after tts are truly diligent students in maths look the bs final jason sent us.
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Apr 11th, 2018",1.0,5.0,if its like the coordinator said why average is on our transcript? are you judging the school and all the other universities in the world on grading scheme like why would average even exists in statistics?
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Apr 10th, 2018",1.0,3.0,Absolutely refuses to compromise his vision of what the course should look like even when all his students are dropping. Very stubborn marker.
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Apr 10th, 2018",1.0,4.0,"Not accessible outside of class. Horrible at organizing TAs to answer questions during office hours. Very miserable and stubborn style of exam questions, especially the last 20 marks, which deducts 2 marks for wrong answers. Extremely discouraging."
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Apr 10th, 2018",1.0,5.0,"70% drop rate explains it all. Doesn't release course averages, doesn't release solutions for problem sets, and explicitly says no curves when it's quite clear most of the class did very bad on the term tests."
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Apr 10th, 2018",5.0,4.0,"Professor Siefken always mention about study habit, which is indeed important for the course. He made this course enjoying and fair, all my class skipping friend who wish to attend tutor company in order to get good grade dropped. But in other course, this may not be the case. Happy to see no paying to get good grade at UofT!"
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Apr 10th, 2018",5.0,3.0,"I am glad to be in his section. His lecture size is 196, but only 25-30 student go to his lecture after the test 1. 85% don't attend no wonder they drop. Prof Siefken explain everything with intuition and super helpful if you are confused with concepts. His marking is also fair, never give machinery questions, but testing your comprehension ."
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Apr 10th, 2018",1.0,3.0,"Professor Siefken is the course coordinator for MAT224 this year. However, he lacks the experience of properly managing a course, which refers to maintaining a reasonable average, organizing TAs to answer questions on Piazza and during office hours. The 70% dropout rate indicates his low capability of being a course coordinator."
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Mar 29th, 2018",5.0,3.0,"U of T need more teacher like this for 200 math course, so math department dont have to take in that many student each year who are not really into mathematics. His marking is pretty fair since it not only measures your efforts but also understanding of mathematics. If you can get a good mark on his class which means mathematics is for you."
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Mar 17th, 2018",5.0,4.0,He is a really nice prof!
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Mar 14th, 2018",1.0,5.0,He seems to assume that you know all the content from book and not talk about them systematically in class. Problem sets are not helping with exams at all. And courses not well organized.
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Mar 14th, 2018",1.0,5.0,condescending prof. Super hard midterms
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Mar 13th, 2018",1.0,5.0,To hard to get higher grade in his class. No average and curve are unfair.
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Mar 13th, 2018",1.0,5.0,"By the end of term test 2, more than half the students who were enrolled at the start of the semester has dropped the course. Refuses to adjust his teaching methods/evaluation methods despite negative feedback. Overall, just an absolutely disastrous course coordinator."
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Mar 12th, 2018",1.0,5.0,Honestly I have never seen a prof who sends emails to encourage students to drop his course
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Mar 12th, 2018",1.0,5.0,"Youll never know the course average cuz he would not be reported if students dont see the course average. His purpose probably is not push you to study the math, but is to let you know how cruel the world is. The worst prof Ive ever had in my life."
Jason Siefken,MAT224,"Mar 4th, 2018",1.0,5.0,"His ''gifted'' teaching method will mislead your thoughts and mess something even though you've already known, with an ease."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Feb 13th, 2018",3.0,3.0,I took his linear Algebra this term and I think he is a good prof. His lec is full of joy and he always pays attention to interaction with students.
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Jan 24th, 2018",5.0,4.0,Professor SIefkin counts among the rare breed of inspired professors. He teaches with enthusiasm and makes you love his subject. It's a joy to attend class.
Jason Siefken,MAT135,"Jan 20th, 2018",1.0,4.0,"Very confusing professor, instead of going through problems methodically and actually teaching, he goes off tangent and puts up very abstract questions that he never actually ends up solving. Pointless lecture, switch if you have him or just learn from the textbook. He did not prepare our class well for the final exam."
Jason Siefken,MAT135H,"Jan 9th, 2018",1.0,4.0,"most confusing prof i've had. puts questions up and makes you work through them on your own and then never takes them up. also doesn't stick to the syllabus so everything kinda comes out of nowhere. when he does put things on the board, he doesn't explain them at all. asks questions and doesn't answer them. take a different section if you can!"
Jason Siefken,MAT135,"Jan 3rd, 2018",1.0,3.0,"Like everyone else says, he's passionate but can't teach. He tries to explain simple concepts in such a roundabout way that they get too confusing. His lectures never line up with the scheduled topics that the homework is on. I felt that the 3 hours of lectures a week was better spent when I didn't attend class and study with the textbook instead."
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Dec 11th, 2017",1.0,4.0,His teaching style is very confusing. He confuses even about the concepts that you know before. He encourages discussing the problems with the person beside you first and after that doesn't explain the solution properly. I don't recommend taking his class
Jason Siefken,MAT135,"Nov 21st, 2017",1.0,4.0,he teaches in a very confusing way. Makes you get confused about the things that you already know. does not do problem solving.
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Oct 26th, 2017",2.0,4.0,"Nice person and passionate about the subject. However, his teaching methods can be quite confusing."
Jason Siefken,MAT135,"Oct 26th, 2017",1.0,3.0,"the professor is passionate. buuuuuut, he will make the concepts confusing even if u have learnt it before. he will cluster on the concepts but just don't get straightforward. i always don't know what his examples are asking about . it's quite different form the problems in the midterm test. i didn't go to his lectures and i still got 97% in test!"
Jason Siefken,MAT223,"Oct 26th, 2017",1.0,3.0,Confusing
Armanpreet Pannu,MAT291,"Dec 23rd, 2024",5.0,1.0,Best professor for calculus 3. Ensures he goes at a good pace so that going to lectures is worth it. Explains everything thoroughly and addresses all doubts during and after class. Super approachable and an excellent professor.
Armanpreet Pannu,MAT291,"Dec 15th, 2023",5.0,3.0,Professor Pannu is an amazing lecturer. He explains the class concepts quite well and does lots of walk through examples that allowed me to best understand the content. I was always paying attention in his lectures. Bless Pannu ily!
Armanpreet Pannu,MAT291,"Dec 9th, 2023",4.0,3.0,"Great professor! Concepts were explained well, I would've wanted more practice problems and things but I think this was an issue with the course itself not Prof Pannu. He could explain things well and did not have an uptight energy!"
Armanpreet Pannu,MAT291,"Dec 8th, 2023",5.0,1.0,"So good at explaining things. Such a hard course, and genuinely his lectures were the only things keeping me sane throughout the course. Is very very good at answering questions, and in general is just very approachable and fun"
Armanpreet Pannu,MAT291,"Dec 8th, 2023",5.0,4.0,"Prof. Pannu at UofT is exceptional. Best teacher I've had; he's dedicated, ensures everyone understands, and adds humor to learning. His ability as a grad student and teacher is inspiring. He sets a high standard for teaching excellence go to his section and not the other one  he shld be in charge . Hope to cross paths again. Good luck, Mr. Pannu!"
Armanpreet Pannu,MAT291,"Dec 7th, 2023",5.0,1.0,"Makes everything extremely understandable and clear, and teaches nothing more than you need to know, which is great for a hard course like this. Answers every question in class until whoever asks is satisfied. Teaches how to actually approach questions in steps, which makes tests and quizzes much easier. Clearly cares about the students."
Armanpreet Pannu,MAT291,"Dec 7th, 2023",5.0,2.0,Good analogies and engaging lectures. Teaches us exactly what we need to know and why we need to know it. Encourages the class to develop good study habits and cares about every one of his student's understanding of the material. You'd be lucky to have him.
Armanpreet Pannu,MAT291,"Dec 7th, 2023",1.0,3.0,"Makes constant mistakes in class, it disrupts the flow of learning showing consistent unpreparedness for the class. The mistakes can get so bad that 20-30% of the class may just be gone simply from those mistakes. The only reason the grades are normal looking for the students taking his course is because he tells us exactly the questions on it."
Armanpreet Pannu,MAT291,"Dec 6th, 2023",5.0,2.0,"this guy is a legend, I hated 186 and 187 but this guy made me like calculus again"
Armanpreet Pannu,MAT291,"Dec 1st, 2023",5.0,1.0,"Arman is an amazing prof! He is v funny (unintentionally), really good at explaining concepts (love the analogies!), and he made the course worthwhile. Even though calc 3 is supposed to be a difficult course, he explained things super well, and the environment was conducive to my learning. Would take again! (if i fail - plz let the final be easy)"
Armanpreet Pannu,MAT237,"Aug 8th, 2023",5.0,1.0,"He explains things well and always answers students' questions in details,"
Armanpreet Pannu,MAT291,"Dec 20th, 2022",5.0,3.0,Professor Pannu is an amazing lecturer. He explains things in a very intuitive way and creates a nice environment for the class. It's really easy asking questions in his class as he is very kind and cares for his students. His office hours outside of class are also very helpful and its really easy to approach him to ask questions.
Armanpreet Pannu,MAT291,"Dec 3rd, 2022",5.0,4.0,Prof Pannu is a great professor. His lectures are really clear and he simplifies complicated topics in a way we can understand.
Armanpreet Pannu,MAT291,"Dec 1st, 2022",5.0,3.0,"Pannu was a very good professor, he prepared a lot of demonstrations and had very good visualization tactics that assisted us with problems. Good teaching style and cares about the class. Would recommend"
Armanpreet Pannu,MAT291,"Dec 1st, 2022",5.0,4.0,"Awesome Professor, explained concepts really well and is very clear about what to expect on quizzes. His teaching method is great and works better than the alternative flipped classroom method in other sections."
Armanpreet Pannu,MAT291,"Nov 30th, 2022",5.0,4.0,"- Good teaching style, inclusive, and gives good analogies 
- Quizzes are challenging but not unfair
- Likes to keep the mood light which creates an approachable environment
- Inspirational"

Armanpreet Pannu,MAT237,"Oct 9th, 2022",4.0,5.0,"this professor's lectures are not very interesting and very heavy
homework? consult thaddeus page
exams are okay except for the final which kills
he is a good person overall and cares about students' well-being and traumas (to be fair they got the trauma by taking this class)
i hope he can quit engineering"
Belinda Wang,ECE110,"Sep 7th, 2024",5.0,2.0,"I don't remember how many students skipped other professors' sections and specifically attended her lecture - I was one of them. Thank her for saving my ECE110 class. It was very clear and easy to understand, and the teaching speed was very moderate, except that you needed to practice a lot after class. Sometimes it's also very humorous."
Belinda Wang,ECE231,"Apr 22nd, 2024",4.0,1.0,"explanations are surface levels, notes are super clear and logical. Simply read off the notes can give you a decent mark, going lecture is wasting your time"
Belinda Wang,ECE110,"Jan 23rd, 2024",5.0,2.0,Concepts are well-explained by Professor Wang using analogies and cross-references to other concepts in physics. Her lectures generate a potential difference that drives our electrical charges to thrive in the sea of knowledge.
Belinda Wang,ECE212,"Jan 19th, 2024",1.0,3.0,"Her lecture notes had a lot of pre-written content on it already, so if you are try and follow by taking notes, then be prepared to just copy her notes as fast as possible. No time to actually absorb any of the lecture content. Talking about the actual lecture itself, her voice is really flat, so classes are excellent time to take naps."
Belinda Wang,ECE110,"Jan 19th, 2024",1.0,5.0,"Had her for ECE110, be prepared to fall asleep in class. Her lectures are so trash that they will make you more confused than you were ever before. Reading the textbook and doing practice exercises + WILEY questions, and understanding the content will get you much farther in the course than anything else."
Belinda Wang,ECE212,"Jan 4th, 2024",3.0,3.0,"Had her for ECE110, and did not disappoint for ECE212. Posts good lecture notes and is very clear in explanations. However, she had a lot of pre-written content on her notes which made the lecture pace a little fast and confusing near the end of the course. Still a safe option if you are deciding between profs though!"
Belinda Wang,ECE241,"Jan 2nd, 2024",4.0,2.0,Explain the concept clearly and has very clear notes to be looked at. Some mistakes in the notes though.
Belinda Wang,ECE110,"Dec 21st, 2023",4.0,3.0,"Prof. Wang explains concepts well and does a lot of example problems in class which helps grasp concepts. She posted her notes online after class, which were a good study resource. She's a nice prof, but can give confusing answers to questions in class. She teaches many upper year ECE courses, so getting used to her lecture style may be a plus."
Belinda Wang,ECE110,"Jun 4th, 2023",3.0,4.0,"good notes, lots of self learning required (especially for labs), wileyplus sucks (textbook+assignment software), patient with students, fast paced lectures, need to study on your own a lot"
Belinda Wang,ECE110,"Apr 22nd, 2021",2.0,4.0,"Throughout the semester, Prof. Wang answered little to no questions on Piazza. This lack of communication caused mass amounts of confusion for all students. Also, her lectures lack a lot of interaction as she mostly just reads off her notes."
Belinda Wang,ECE241,"Dec 18th, 2020",1.0,4.0,"Professor is really bad at communicating. Her videos are very monotonous and hard to sit through, while Paul Chow's are fine. On the exams, expect point deductions in the strangest places for requirements that exist in the professor's head, but were never stated in the question."
Belinda Wang,ECE241,"Dec 17th, 2020",1.0,5.0,"Absolute yikes. Professor Wang doesn't teach material in depth and just readily assumes all students already know everything about digital logic. No clear help on piazza and extremely tough with grading criteria. Answer doesn't match marking scheme expectations? Get ready to get a 0. Also very skewed midterms to finals weightage, each being 30%."
Belinda Wang,ECE241,"Oct 29th, 2020",1.0,4.0,"Be prepared to do a lot of guesswork as to what is actually required for your labs, assignments, and midterms. The course requires everything to be done in a very specific (and highly redundant) way, so even if you get the answer correct, be prepared to lose marks for failing to read the professors mind about what the ""correct"" method was."
Belinda Wang,ECE110,"Oct 17th, 2020",4.0,3.0,"Gives good lectures. Does NOT put up with people chatting on her class (which I personally like, take it outside). Put in the work and she will gladly help you. One gripe is that this particular class (ECE110) requires purchasing WileyPlus (a terrible piece of software) but I'm not sure if she is even in control of that."
Belinda Wang,ECE110,"Sep 15th, 2019",5.0,3.0,"Probably the best Prof. for analog and digital systems. Amazing teaching ability, very clear and practical. Doesn't just recite the textbook, has a great style."
Belinda Wang,ECE241,"Aug 13th, 2018",4.0,5.0,"This course is fundamental to ECE243 in the next semester, otherwise of little value by itself. Nice prof, but lots of self-learning is required to figure things out, especially for labs. Labs (pre-labs especially) are very time-consuming, but worth very little."
Belinda Wang,ECE241,"Jul 7th, 2016",1.0,3.0,She is the worst prof ever
Belinda Wang,ECE110,"Mar 16th, 2016",5.0,1.0,A great prof!!

Belinda Wang,ECE110,"Oct 26th, 2011",4.0,2.0,"The course was pretty easy. Same with the prof. Also, Belinda totally sparked my circuits, and I offered very low resistance."
Belinda Wang,ECE110,"Apr 2nd, 2011",1.5,4.0,Unclear explanation of the content. very boring lectures. Makes simple concepts really confusing.
Belinda Wang,ECE110,"Dec 11th, 2009",1.0,5.0,"She is awful in teaching and interacting with students. She might seem ok in the beginning, but wait until you get your final mark. She does not know how to teach, students never got anything from her and she tests students on stuff they never learned. When your marks vaporize, you should know why.Mean and unhelpful."
Belinda Wang,ECE241,"Jan 21st, 2009",4.0,4.0,She is very helpful and a pretty good teacher overall.  She's always available to help if you need it.  The only downside is that she can be a bit boring in lecture sometimes.
Belinda Wang,ECE110,"Apr 19th, 2008",3.0,4.0,"Always helpful, whenever you miss a lecture, u can ask her to email you the notes..
 I sometimes fail to understand what she says because of her accent. Nevertheless, she is a cool prof, who intersperses 'yo' in almost every sentence she speaks!"

Belinda Wang,ECE241,"Feb 28th, 2006",4.5,1.0,"Probably the best prof I had in my 3 years of ECE!  Those who said her notes suck or don't know a thing clearly is ignorant.

EXTREMELY friendly and approachable, even outside of class!!"

Berj Bardakjian,ECE445,"Dec 17th, 2016",1.0,5.0,"The worst prof I've ever had and an even worse test writer. The questions are one line asking to ""derive this"" or ""describe this"" and then he gives you 2 blank pages to condense all the key points of an entire chapter in to an answer.

Berj Bardakjian,ECE445,"Oct 31st, 2016",2.0,4.0,"He spends more time talking about how the students should understand/know something instead of actually explaining the concepts.

Not my best prof, but not the worst."
Berj Bardakjian,ECE445,"Nov 20th, 2012",1.0,4.0,Horrible. He disguises his inability to teach behind crazy enthusiasm. Only cares about the students with good grades. Everyone else is class average fodder.

Xilin Liu,ECE110,"Jan 9th, 2025",1.0,5.0,Rather unmotivated prof. He really doesn't care about what he puts on the slides. Tests and exams can be very different from the slides.
Xilin Liu,ECE110,"Apr 23rd, 2024",2.0,3.0,Prof. Liu loves to challenge the students and make them cry by making the exams hard. That's not good.
Xilin Liu,ECE110,"Jan 19th, 2024",1.0,3.0,"His lectures were a complete waste of time. He just mostly read the slides and copy pasted the fill in the blanks on the slides from his notes. Explanations were awful, just reading out from slides. People on piazza also commented that his notes actually skipped a major question that was 20% of the final exam."
Xilin Liu,ECE110,"Jan 19th, 2024",1.0,3.0,"Lectures usually involved him reading his own notes and copying his notes to the slides and just repeating the said slide out loud. Lecturer was extremely hard to understand, very thick accent. Reading the textbook and doing textbook questions is going to be far more useful for this course anyways."
Xilin Liu,ECE110,"Aug 30th, 2022",5.0,4.0,"His lectures and notes are extremely helpful! Seeing similar problems in the exam, following his steps, and ace the course."
Xilin Liu,ECE110,"Aug 8th, 2022",5.0,3.0,"His lecture and slides are very helpful, showing the steps of solving the problems. By understanding the solutions in his slides and following the same steps in the exams, you'll receive good grades."

Xilin Liu,ECE331,"Jan 13th, 2022",5.0,1.0,Just an excellent Professor in and out of the classroom. Explains concepts very clearly and gives great notes. Actually cares about his students and always offers extra help if needed. Take ECE331 if he is teaching it. As simple as that.
Xilin Liu,ECE331,"Dec 16th, 2021",5.0,3.0,I had him in his first year teaching. Amazing professor. Makes very clear notes and avoided the textbook as much as possible. Tests weren't hard if you followed his lecture notes. If you didn't do well in ECE231 don't worry - he goes over all the basics in clear and concise manner. ECE231 felt like APS105 whereas ECE331 with Liu feels like ECE244.
Paul Yoo,ECE110,"Jan 12th, 2024",5.0,1.0,Amazing professor. Adheres to textbooks and offers in-depth extensions.
Paul Yoo,BME1472,"Jan 3rd, 2024",5.0,3.0,"The prof is awesome and explains really well! The only issue would be that his slides are mostly images so you really need to concentrate and attend all his lectures, otherwise, it might be a bit difficult to review the slides on your own."
Paul Yoo,ECE110,"Oct 16th, 2019",5.0,1.0,Best prof from first year. He really knows what he is talking about and he can really convey those concepts to his students. ECE110 will make you love circuits before second year makes you hate them.
Paul Yoo,ECE110,"Apr 16th, 2017",5.0,4.0,caring prof with lots of engagement. he goes really fast and tend to skip key points if  you leave him to talk the entire time. ask questions and he will take time and try his best to explain
Paul Yoo,ECE110,"Feb 2nd, 2016",1.0,5.0,Good teaching! Although I don't understand.
Paul Yoo,ECE110,"Jan 26th, 2016",1.0,5.0,BAD

Paul Yoo,ECE110,"Apr 10th, 2013",2.0,3.0,"I do not like to talk negatively about Professors and Instructors. But I had a terrible experience with this man's lectures, he might be intelligent, but teaching is not his thing, you do NOT use powerpoint slides for a course that has to do with circuits, I switched out of his class after the 2nd week, else I would have probably failed."
Khoman Phang,ECE231,"Jan 8th, 2025",4.0,3.0,Made the material intuitive but course organization is all over the place. That midterm was DEADLY.
Khoman Phang,ECE231,"Jan 6th, 2025",3.0,5.0,"While Prof Phang is a very nice person, the organization of 231 quizzes is really questionable. These quizzes are worth 15% (total), are out of ~10 marks. They're taken on Quercus, giving us 0 chance to show any process work and removes the chance of students obtaining any partial marks, a heavy penalty for those of us who struggle with the course."
Khoman Phang,ECE334,"Mar 24th, 2023",2.0,5.0,Disorganized content and lectures are hard to follow. 334 is a good course but he is not a good lecturer at all

Khoman Phang,ECE231,"Mar 16th, 2015",4.5,2.0,"I had prof Phang as a substitute professor for 2 lectures (ECE231). I actually liked the course material, just for those two lectures though. His explanation of the concept is pretty clear and it's easy to follow him. He also teaches at a reasonable pace and the class environment is friendly.  Top prof. I'd recommend going to his lectures."
Khoman Phang,ECE334,"Dec 10th, 2014",4.5,1.0,"I've heard lots of great things about him but never actually had him but it's now safe to say those good things were true. His lectures go at a pace where everyone can understand what is going on and his notes are clear most of time. The test can have tricky questions but they aren't bad if you know what you're doing. Also, he's a really nice guy."
Khoman Phang,ECE231,"Jul 12th, 2013",5.0,4.0,Great teacher and person. You can tell he really cares about his students. Simply the best.
Khoman Phang,ECE231,"Feb 13th, 2013",3.0,2.0,Does not explain well at all. Is all over the place. Is very nice and helpful by personality. But not a good prof when it comes to explaining concepts/

The only in-person aspect of the class was the tutorials, and I showed up to maybe 2, but doing past exams really helped. Ramsey is so passionate about chem, it motivated me to do well."
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Nov 2nd, 2021",5.0,1.0,I love this course.
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Oct 21st, 2021",5.0,3.0,I love APS110
Scott Ramsay,APS164,"Jul 17th, 2021",5.0,3.0,my first teacher at u of t and he is one of the best teacher I've ever seen
Scott Ramsay,APS164,"Jan 19th, 2021",5.0,3.0,"Even though I got a low mark in his class, he was one of the best professors I've had. His lectures are very useful in understanding the course material, and his excitement towards the content is infectious."
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Jan 15th, 2021",5.0,2.0,"Best prof last semester, great short videos which go over what you need to know for each topic. Not to mention he is very charismatic."
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Dec 9th, 2020",4.0,3.0,Great guy
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Oct 31st, 2020",5.0,3.0,"A real light during first year engineering here at UofT. Genuinely interested in his craft which shows in his videos. One thing I would say is some test material seems to be inadequately covered in the textbook homework, but other than that, great prof and great class!"
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Oct 31st, 2020",5.0,3.0,"Really nice professor, I got to speak with him during one of the Meet Your Prof dinners and he was very kind. He clearly enjoys what he does and it makes learning that much easier. One of my favourite profs in first year. The midterm was tougher than I expected, but I forgive him ;)"
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Oct 19th, 2020",5.0,3.0,"Passionate guy, really cares about the students and not giving us anxiety."
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Oct 17th, 2020",5.0,3.0,"Gives good lectures with demonstrations in front of the class. Empathetic and willing to help with any question related to the material. Course does require you to purchase TopHat, which is a horrible piece of software."
Scott Ramsay,APS164,"Aug 24th, 2020",5.0,3.0,Took the online course but he wasn't teaching it. We followed his top hat textbook which is amazing and was a hard carry for me through the course.
Scott Ramsay,APS164,"Jul 26th, 2020",5.0,4.0,"I took APS164 which is an online course which revolves around professor Ramsay's online textbook. Although I had a different professor, I made through the course thanks to his textbook, which is very organized, clear visuals, and easy to read, which puts elements of active learning. Excellent well-established course, especially for current pandemic"
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Apr 30th, 2020",5.0,2.0,Very engaging professor in lectures. The class was great and the online support videos were very helpful. The use of tophat is my only complaint.
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Nov 20th, 2019",5.0,2.0,"Best first year prof, truly passionate"
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Jan 11th, 2019",5.0,3.0,Really loved having him as my prof!
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Dec 20th, 2018",3.0,2.0,Cool demos. But he gets way too excited over little things. His short videos are everything.
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Nov 21st, 2018",5.0,3.0,"probably the best 1st year teacher, hes capable of making you want to go into MSE"
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Nov 11th, 2018",5.0,2.0,"If you go to lecture, you will learn a ton from Ramsay, but even if you don't, his short topic videos are an absolute godsend. You could learn the entire course off of them. Overall a really funny and caring prof."
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Oct 24th, 2018",5.0,3.0,"One of the best first year engineering professors. He is constantly making lectures interesting and engaging. Due to his amazing lectures and detailed short videos he posts, learning his material becomes fun and easy."
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Sep 25th, 2018",5.0,3.0,"Professor Ramsay knows how to make students concentrate. Although one of his lectures is starting at 9am on Mondays, he always prepare interesting materials, from FCC structure to bed of nails. Textbook use will not affect his credibility; his lectures are descriptive enough! In my opinion, if you are in his APS110 session, then you are lucky."
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Jun 28th, 2018",5.0,2.0,"Without a doubt one of the best professors in first year engineering. His lectures are always engaging, and actually made me excited to go to school at 9AM. The midterms and final were all easy, and he teaches incredibly well, so you learn a lot and get a good grade :)"
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Jan 23rd, 2018",5.0,3.0,good guy
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Jan 6th, 2018",5.0,1.0,"Easily the best professor I could have asked for. He teaches so incredibly well, and you can always tell hes so passionate about the material. He did end up having to speed through the last topic in the course (electrochemistry), but that was because he had taught the previous subjects so well. Tests range from very easy to reasonable. Recommend!"
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Jan 5th, 2018",5.0,3.0,"Scott Ramsay is easily the best prof in first year. As someone who had lots & lots go wrong during my first semester (including right up to the day of the final), Prof. Ramsay was always so understanding of everything that was going on; always willing to help. His lectures were fantastic & I used his office hours pretty often; I loved his class."
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Dec 19th, 2017",5.0,3.0,Cares about students actually understanding what is being taught in class.
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Jul 25th, 2017",5.0,3.0,Very understanding of students and any circumstance they may have. Passionate about the material and was really enjoyable to learn from. Only criticism is that this passion for students can sometimes deter time from learning the material. Be prepared to do some self-learning
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Jul 19th, 2017",5.0,3.0,"Great prof! All lectures were posted on YouTube, so class isn't mandatory. Although final exam was very difficult."
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Jan 12th, 2017",5.0,3.0,Really an amazing and caring prof! I always really looked forward to his lectures and they brightened up my day. He made a great effort to make sure students understand and feel confident with their abilities. I hope to be in one of his classes again in the future.
Scott Ramsay,APS110,"Dec 3rd, 2016",5.0,3.0,"Best Prof I've ever had, makes learning genuinely fun."
Scott Ramsay,APS164,"Nov 28th, 2016",5.0,3.0,"He was my best Professor during first year, despite being a little disorganised since it's a new course, he was very inspirational and genuinely interested in the material he teaches. And he would transfer that passion to the students."
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Nov 12th, 2016",5.0,2.0,One of the best professors in first year Engineering. Inspirational and humorous lectures. The tests should not be hard once you have high school knowledge in physics and chemistry.
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Jan 18th, 2016",4.5,3.0,Great prof.
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Dec 18th, 2015",5.0,2.0,Best prof in the first year engineering. Literally made me hate I'm not an MSE. Would retake the course every semester if I could. His lectures are the coolest in the whole first year and he's such a nerdboy. Amazing guy.
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Oct 2nd, 2015",5.0,1.0,he's really cool !
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Aug 27th, 2015",5.0,1.0,interesting lec
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Feb 22nd, 2015",5.0,3.0,"Great teacher. Conveys his messages clearly. Easily the best professor I've had at UofT so far.  His tests are not tough, but tricky. You can't do well in the exams with just formulae. You need to read the textbook, understand what he says and you will do well."
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Jan 11th, 2015",1.5,3.0,"Labs were hard, but midterms were easy. Book is must have. Lectures are not that good. Do all assigned problems, guaranteed it will be on exams."
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Jan 7th, 2015",3.5,3.0,Go to lectures for sure since that's what he mostly tests on and you'll soon realize you can't try to learn from the textbook yourself. His class was the most enjoyable by far. He's very encouraging when you ask questions and doesn't try to make you feel stupid like some other profs I've had.
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Jan 5th, 2015",1.5,5.0,"Lectures are very clear, however they just cover the very tip of the whole iceberg, very superficial. Additionally he does not cover the whole material of the course, which by the way is terribly organized.  He expects you to know absolutely everything he says during lectures, specially extravagant examples and materials."
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"May 6th, 2014",5.0,3.0,Very good prof. enthusiastic and clear. The course was very well organized. Tons of videos and study aid materials were made available online. Overall a good experience.
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Apr 26th, 2014",3.0,4.0,"I totally not understand his lecture at all, but I have to admit that he is a really nice and helpful prof."
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Apr 4th, 2014",2.5,5.0,"He makes fun in class, but you will feel awful after exams. He did not organize his lecture well."
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Dec 21st, 2013",2.0,5.0,"This course covers a significant amount of material. Lectures are completely useless unless you do pre-readings or know the stuff beforehand, because you will have no idea of what he is talking about since the content is all new, and they cover little content. The textbook is CRITICAL to your success in this course. I can't stress that enough."
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Dec 15th, 2013",3.0,5.0,Explains course material really well. Tests are about anything but the stuff he teaches in class.
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Dec 14th, 2013",2.0,5.0,"He can make you laugh in class, and cry after test."
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Dec 11th, 2013",3.5,4.0,"good prof, had to watch online lectures to understand tho"
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"May 31st, 2013",4.0,5.0,Lecture content was completely irrelevant to what was tested. Did not do one example problem all semester..
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"May 9th, 2013",4.5,3.0,"Cool prof, really nice and likes to keep his lectures interesting."
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Apr 28th, 2013",3.0,3.0,The course was easy but tests became harder under his magical hand.
Scott Ramsay,MSE1001,"Jan 31st, 2013",5.0,3.0,He keeps lectures interesting
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Jan 18th, 2013",4.0,2.0,"Very cool guy, tries his best to make lectures interesting. :)"
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Oct 25th, 2012",1.5,1.0,"He is well suited for the introductory first year course, puts a lot of effort into creating visual displays. But when it comes down to it has very superficial understanding of material. Very dissapointed in his third year course. Has a temper and does not respond well to criticism. Poor communication, when needed outside of lecture."
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Apr 11th, 2012",2.5,4.0,"NEVER replies to emails. No help what so ever. but only good thing, he uploads his lecture videos. and hired some GOOD tutors for the tutorials and lab sessions."
Scott Ramsay,MSELEC,"Dec 18th, 2011",4.5,2.0,"He was really helpful, he personally helped me a lot and he's really funny. He made the class pretty interesting and has a lot of extra resources for the class."
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Nov 11th, 2011",2.0,5.0,Doesn't teach anything that will be on his tests or problem sets. Useless
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Oct 18th, 2011",4.5,4.0,"good prof, very dedicated.. but like to play tricks on exams"
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Oct 11th, 2011",4.5,5.0,"Very nice prof. He is helpful. However, his tests are insanely tough. He plays all sorts of tricks, things which you will never think of! But he is a really nice person, though and very dedicated. However I'll rather have a prof who is not nice to you and gives easy tests. lol"
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Sep 11th, 2011",5.0,3.0,"Really awesome, super funny and entertaining..I had no interest in the course going into it and left wanting to do research in Materials Science! Ramsay is the bomb.  Fact."
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Aug 14th, 2011",3.5,2.0,"I did feel he played a few ""tricks"" on the quizzes and exams which bothered me. Gets a good rating because he often made the classes very entertaining and was fairly organized and clear"
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Mar 23rd, 2011",5.0,5.0,:)
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Dec 20th, 2010",2.5,4.0,"While most of the professor try to help the students before the finals by posting solutions to the past papers etc, this prof. does not. Past papers without solutions are almost useless --you can't even tell if you're doing the right thing or not."
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Nov 17th, 2010",1.0,5.0,I hate MSE101!!!!!!!!!!
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Oct 22nd, 2010",4.0,4.0,"He is a very good professor, much better than any other prof for Materials"
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Aug 6th, 2010",3.0,4.0,"prof treated students like highschool, would kick you of if you were late and gave away chocolate. wouldnt answer questions because they would be on the exam (why would u run a pre exam help sessiona nd then not answer the questions asked) and liked to use tricks on exams. did not enjoy my experience with this prof. hope i never get him again"
Scott Ramsay,MSE1,"Jan 13th, 2010",1.0,5.0,what a...
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Dec 11th, 2009",1.0,5.0,Has no feelings for the students at all.
Scott Ramsay,MSE001,"Apr 19th, 2009",3.5,3.0,He gave chocolates in class and his every example involved food somehow
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Jan 28th, 2009",1.0,5.0,"this prof is the worset ever. he is so unorganized, loves to wast time and screw students in the quizes. Unfair and unhelpful, the labs were a mess, unclear and undoable. he even set the office hours for the labs when we had a CLASS and he was informed. should not be teaching."
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Dec 16th, 2008",1.5,5.0,"He was TERRIBLE! Was not available during office hours, went way too fast (because he realized he was running behind), gave not examples, and rushed through important material."
Scott Ramsay,MSE440,"Jan 4th, 2008",3.5,2.0,"Good learning experience.  Slides were useful and prof had a laid back, easy to follow style.  Had excursions which was cool."
Scott Ramsay,MSE101,"Oct 24th, 2004",5.0,3.0,Coolest instructor........makes nice animations n graphics............interactive classes..........helpful n friendly
Salma Emara,ECE244,"Jan 14th, 2025",5.0,2.0,THE GOAT!!
Salma Emara,ECE244,"Jan 8th, 2025",5.0,2.0,"Absolute sweetheart, clearly cares about her students and she's very fair and takes feedback very seriously."
Salma Emara,APS105,"Aug 13th, 2024",5.0,2.0,"Amazing prof, engaging, fun to be around and talk to. 1000/10 would take another class with her again."
Salma Emara,ECE244,"Apr 13th, 2024",3.0,2.0,"Good prof, loves to teach"
Salma Emara,ECE1513,"Mar 1st, 2024",5.0,4.0,She teaches very well with many examples and clearly! Assignments are challenging.
Salma Emara,ECE244,"Jan 24th, 2024",5.0,2.0,"Like a lot of the previous reviews, I completely agree that she is hands-down the best prof in the entire ECE department. She always replies on Piazza faster than I can even blink and her lectures are some of the most well-prepared and delivered lectures you'll ever attend."
Salma Emara,APS105,"Jan 20th, 2024",5.0,3.0,I was a complete beginner to any type of coding whatsoever and I probably would have failed the course if it wasn't for her. Her lectures are carefully planned and she's very engaging. She's accessible during office hours and clearly cares about her students.
Salma Emara,ECE244,"Jan 6th, 2024",5.0,3.0,Took her class for the second time and she did not disappoint. Wrote a sequel textbook for this course and continued to teach clearly with lots of code tracing and drawings. Always open to student questions and will take the time to sit with you and help you debug your code. I wish I could be in her class again after this. Awesome prof!!
Salma Emara,APS105,"Dec 21st, 2023",5.0,2.0,Lectures are amazing; Many drawings and code walkthroughs done to help everyone understand course material. Wrote her own textbook complete with visuals and practice questions. Very accessible & always open to help/chat w/students. The definition of what a professor should be. I went in with no coding experience but aced the course thanks to her.
Salma Emara,ECE244,"Dec 18th, 2023",5.0,4.0,"Professor Salma Emara has proven to be an extraordinary educator. Her clear and patient approach to teaching, coupled with her enthusiastic and energetic demeanor, has greatly enhanced the learning experience. She excels in making complex concepts understandable, and her dedication to student success is evident in every interaction."
Salma Emara,ECE244,"Nov 8th, 2023",5.0,3.0,"She explains concepts clearly. Very patient with questions. Her enthusiasm and energy makes me look forward to every lecture. Very approachable, even with many students in her office hours, she manages to be patient and answer all questions clearly."
Salma Emara,APS105,"Nov 2nd, 2023",5.0,2.0,Salma is a really amazing prof!! She explains things clearly and is really dedicated to helping students succeed. Salma is also a wonderful and kind person. She also gives out ducks for answering questions!!( which has made lectures really fun). Her APS105 textbook was really helpful and I have learnt so much in her ECE244. Praise Queen Salma!
Salma Emara,APS105,"Aug 8th, 2023",5.0,3.0,"Prof Emara is amazing and cares so much about her students. Best prof in the entire ECE department, you lucked out if you got her. If you have programming experience, lectures are kind of optional bc she maintains her own textbook very well and you can just study off that"
Salma Emara,APS105,"Jun 4th, 2023",5.0,4.0,"amazing prof, amazing lectures, pretty difficult course (especially for someone who has never coded before), accessible outside class, super dedicated, has great notes+wrote the textbook herself,  super dedicated, very sweet, very patient, be sure to interact with her in class"
Salma Emara,APS105,"Jun 2nd, 2023",5.0,3.0,"I never went to office hours first year because I was intimidated by the idea. Prof Emara's office hours were the first I ever attended, and they were great. There was no rush, and she talked me through my code step by step. She is also always active on Piazza which is very useful. My favourite prof at UofT so far."
Salma Emara,APS105,"May 17th, 2023",5.0,1.0,"Professor Emara is an incredibly skilled and engaging lecturer, with a passion for the subject that is infectious. She goes through each course concept slowly and deliberately with plenty of examples, and always takes great care to answer each question. A very kind and approachable person and definitely my favourite professor at UofT so far."
Salma Emara,APS105,"Apr 7th, 2023",5.0,3.0,"by far the best prof I've had in first year - holds lots of office hours, is quick to reply on piazza (our discussion board) and always goes above and beyond for students. lecture notes are clear and concise (althought the pacing can be a bit slow for those with experience in C). would gladly take a class with her again!"
Salma Emara,APS105,"Mar 21st, 2023",5.0,3.0,one of the nicest people you will meet. never went to her lectures but she made our textbook and it was the best thing I've ever read
Salma Emara,APS105,"Sep 7th, 2022",5.0,5.0,"She is just a great prof, and that was her first year teaching! I believe Prof Salma will leave a mark on the UofT engineering department. Not only her lectures are engaging and comprehensive, but she is always ready to help outside class, even beyond the course material. If she teaches upper-year courses in the future, I will definitely take them."
Salma Emara,APS105,"Jul 14th, 2022",5.0,2.0,"Salma was the best professor I had in first year!! Her lectures were full of energy, useful examples and important notes. She understands the pressure that a first year student has better than anyone else and cares about every single question that is asked in person or online. I hope I get the chance to have courses with her again in UofT."
Salma Emara,APS105,"Mar 14th, 2022",5.0,3.0,"Her teaching skills are extremely strong, despite it being her first year as a lecturer. She is also very quick to answer questions posted on the online discussion board. There are tenured professors who can not teach as clearly as she can."
Salma Emara,APS105,"Sep 24th, 2021",5.0,3.0,She is a very good TA. She uses lots of example to clarify concepts. Her online tutorials made me pass this course.
Jon Eyolfson,ECE344,"Dec 19th, 2024",5.0,4.0,"Great prof, engaging lectures, clear grading schemes and test. Best prof of the year"
Jon Eyolfson,ECE344,"Dec 12th, 2024",5.0,2.0,Genuinely one of the best profs in the ECE department.

Jon Eyolfson,ECE344,"Dec 6th, 2024",5.0,1.0,Professor Jon 344 class is amazing. He repiles so fast on Discord and the resource available for this course really helps the students a lot.
Jon Eyolfson,ECE344,"Nov 30th, 2024",5.0,3.0,"goat, never had to attend class as all lectures were recorded, and he often made lectures entertaining by showing the class how to mess with first-years on their computer using class content XD ie fork bomb. interesting lectures and very helpful (can dm on discord). process and thread labs took more time but overall lighter course. 10/10"
Jon Eyolfson,ECE454,"Nov 18th, 2024",2.0,3.0,"Using discord for Q&A was such a chaos. He seldom answered questions, but when he did the discord channels were just flushed by countless questions and we just easily missed some questions out. He gave answers in fragments, or just skipped over some questions (I asked three times about lab grade before he replied), a messy prof in general"
Jon Eyolfson,ECE344,"Oct 22nd, 2024",5.0,4.0,"Hard course by nature but prof is funny, nice, helpful, and accessible."
Jon Eyolfson,ECE344,"Aug 30th, 2024",5.0,2.0,"Absolutely amazing professor, he cares about all of his students and it really shows! The amount of effort that he puts into his lectures, labs and other content to make it easy and accessible for students is jaw dropping. Lots of resources available for help both online and in person. One of the best professors I've had in university!"
Jon Eyolfson,ECE344,"Dec 6th, 2023",5.0,4.0,"Imagine a prof using Discord to talk with students and answer questions (you can also just DM him and he responds quickly), livestreaming on Youtube and you can also choose to watch the recordings. Very open to any comments and concerns, very well organized lectures, tough but interesting labs. Best UofT prof."
Jon Eyolfson,ECE344,"Dec 3rd, 2023",5.0,3.0,"He's one of the best profs in my 5 years here at UofT. I wish he had more courses available. This was my second attempt at O.S. and I'm glad I got to take it with him. Always available to discuss concepts and the labs in my opinion are very fair, it's a great opportunity to develop your understanding of the concepts. He has a knack for teaching."
Jon Eyolfson,ECE344,"Oct 27th, 2023",5.0,5.0,one of the best professors at uoft ece
Jon Eyolfson,ECE344,"Apr 28th, 2023",5.0,4.0,"[ECE353, NOT 344] Super nice person and the best prof I've had. ECE353 was one of the more challenging courses I've taken but the most rewarding! Learned a lot !!!"
Jon Eyolfson,ECE344,"Apr 25th, 2023",5.0,3.0,"Very good experience. Professor Eyolfson was extremely organized and accommodating, the labs were a challenge but very manageable (he says he redid them this semester since the previous ones were bad), the lectures were great, easily the best Prof I've had in 3rd year."
Jon Eyolfson,ECE344,"Apr 25th, 2023",5.0,3.0,ECE353 Prof makes a potentially course enjoyable. Lectures cover topics in detail. He runs a Discord server and is always active to answer questions. Posts all his lectures on YouTube. I have not had a prof at U of T who has impressed me as much with how much effort they put into teaching. If you get the chance you should take this course with him.
Jon Eyolfson,ECE344,"Apr 25th, 2023",5.0,3.0,"(ECE353 not ECE344) Jon is great! He was super available outside of class, always going the extra mile by helping students debug code on discord and answering questions. Really appreciated how he went out of his way to solicit feedback from students throughout the course, and make sure that we were ""getting it"" Lectures were well structured."
Jon Eyolfson,ECE344,"Nov 20th, 2022",5.0,2.0,"Super nice, and always on discord. Students can easily reach out to him. Love his lecture, containing many fun code demo, and some extracurricular concept which is really fun to learn about. However, his lecture might not be super helpful for the quizzes and tests."
